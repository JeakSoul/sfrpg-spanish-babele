			"description": "<p>Measuring up to 100 feet from their eel-like jaws to their four-part tails and weighing hundreds of tons, abynthics are among the largest and most formidable creatures found in the seas of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.tvbcahAbnqDGepHf]{Entha}. While they&rsquo;re swimming on long migratory patterns that circumnavigate the planet&rsquo;s full circumference twice a year, their segmented tails cleave together and function as one powerful limb that propels them through the depths. Abynthics are incredibly flflexible for their size and can use their tails individually to attack with devastating effffect when they happen across a worthy meal.</p>\n<p>These carnivorous giants attack their prey by fifirst ramming into it with their massive jaws, then clamping down with enormous pressure and bringing their flflexible tails to bear. When they&rsquo;ve appropriately subdued and tenderized a creature, they swallow it whole.</p>\n<p>Abynthics are constantly on the move and have no established hunting grounds. Often, their travel takes them through smaller ecosystems, where their voracious appetites can leave devastation in their wake, upsetting an area&rsquo;s fragile balance. On @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.tvbcahAbnqDGepHf]{Entha}, the only refuges from these massive creatures are the magical reefs that supernaturally decrease the surrounding water pressure; abynthics are adapted to the high pressure of the deep sea and fare poorly in shallow and low-pressure environments.<br />Many other worlds contain creatures that closely resemble abynthics, though most have notable differences in their number of tails or diet; some are even herbivorous. Sapient species study, fear, or even worship these mysterious beings wherever they appear&mdash;but nothing is known about their reproductive cycle. Some posit that the massive creatures are effectively immortal, dropped fully formed into the seas by some divine entity, as no abynthic young, eggs, or decaying remains have ever been found. The leviathans can be killed, however, and powerful mercenaries regularly mount expeditions to hunt abynthics. These poachers primarily want the creatures&rsquo; uniquely strong jaws, which are sometimes incorporated into deep-sea submersibles to help them withstand enormous pressure.</p>"

		"Ahav": {
			"name": "Ahav",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Military marvels of advanced weaponry and artificial-personality programming, AHAVs are ruthless machines of war, bound by their programming to follow their objectives without pause. The acronym AHAV stands for “autonomous heavy assault vehicle,” reflecting the constructs’ ability to operate independently and make basic decisions on the battlefield. While the term originated with a specific and popular early model produced by Ironfire Industries on Absalom Station shortly after the Gap, the name quickly spread in colloquial use to refer to all robotic war machines of similar designs, and these days many corporations on many different worlds use the term to market their own proprietary models. AHAVs are built to appear intimidating: sturdy armor-plated tanks that float on hovertreads, armed with various heavy weapons and bristling with antennae. AHAVs have a full complement of sensors, capable of detecting heat, vibration, and sometimes other signatures, though they don’t usually have enough processing power to activate every available sense at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>AHAVs are expensive and difficult to construct, so relatively few of them are found in the service of small planetary militaries and mercenary groups. Only the richest of worlds (and collectors interested in ensuring the safety of their private collections) can afford to purchase and maintain even a single AHAV.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unfortunately, since AHAVs’ basic programming leaves little room for independent thought and nuance, many of them can be easily tricked by those who can figure out the literal outlines of their objectives and work around them. As such, AHAVs have dropped off in popularity over the past few decades, though the corporations invested in building them are continually working to improve on this limitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Before they are programmed, AHAVs are outfitted with Mission Dependent Loadouts (MODELs for short), which are special abilities and equipment that aid a robot in its particular mission. An AHAV focused on reconnaissance might have an advanced sensor suite or stealth capabilities, while one intended to go head to head with a superior enemy force might have augmented weaponry. A sufficiently astute observer can use the MODEL of an AHAV to puzzle out its objective.<br/><br/><br/><br/>AHAVs are built to last-a feature that sometimes means their objectives fail before they do. For instance, an AHAV programmed to guard a particular site will continue to do so even though its handlers have long since perished. While such a construct might seem to be a sad sight, it pales in comparison to those AHAVs whose objectives have become unachievable or internally inconsistent over time. Such a state introduces subtle errors into the AHAV’s programming, which can result in behavior that would be called insane if exhibited by a flesh-and-blood creature. A technician who can uncover that robot’s original purpose might be able to speak with the machine, convincing it of the error of its ways or the irrationality of its objective, but AHAVs have an inherently confrontational worldview and are difficult to reason with. AHAVs that successfully confront such a misalignment are most likely to shut down entirely, becoming nothing but inert metal and circuitry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

		"Akata": {
			"name": "Akata",
			"description": "<p>Terrifying predators that dwell in the vast void of space, akatas make their homes on lifeless asteroids, comets, and dying planets, hibernating in cocoons composed of the starmetal noqual for countless centuries. An akata looks similar in shape to a lion, but with hairless, rubbery blue skin and a mane of thick, lashing tentacles. Its face is little more than two eyes glowing with ever-changing light and a fanged maw. Two long tentacular tails extend from its muscular hindquarters. A typical akata stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.<br/><br/>Akatas lack auditory organs, lungs, and vocal cords, and they can’t hear or vocalize in any way. Instead, they communicate with each other through sight and scent. Akatas can change the color of their eyes to over a thousand shades, which they use in conjunction with complex tail movements to communicate visually. Scent glands located just behind the jawbone on akatas’ necks produce a wide variety of smells that other akatas can “taste” with their tongues.<br/><br/>Akatas live in colonies of up to 30 individuals. Massive akatas known as akata alphas rule the largest of these colonies. Most colonies inhabit small asteroids or meteors hurtling through the depths of space. Akatas can hibernate for centuries, protecting themselves in cocoons made from a combination of resin from the creatures’ pores and noqual. When a meteorite carrying an akata colony crashes onto a planet or another astronomical object that can support life, the akatas awake from their cocoons. Akatas usually consume the remains of their cocoons upon awakening, but 1 bulk of noqual worth 500 credits can be harvested from the remnants of a single akata cocoon (see page 64 of Starfinder Armory for more information on noqual). Once awakened, akatas can drastically depopulate a planet as they seek out suitable hosts for their young.</p>"

They provide unobtrusive security wherever anacites anticipate physical violence but also desire to avoid an overt display of force. It is not unusual for anacite ambassadors to be assigned a pair of monitors as guards, for example, and anacite facilities with a large number of non-anacite visitors or employees-such as the Horse Eye Orbital Plate-are home to many of these silent, nearly-invisible warriors. A single monitor is often given authority over security in a given facility; there, they maintain shortwave communication with nearby anacites, extending the monitor’s surveillance range and ability to observe threats. If necessary, the monitor can even direct nearby anacites to intercept security threats.<br/><br/>An anacite monitor is mantis-like in shape, with two delicate-looking wings, six long legs, and a distinctive triangular head.

		"Animated Quartz Swarm": {
			"name": "Animated Quartz Swarm",
			"description": "<p>Though commonly found on many planets, quartz has unusual physical properties, making it a prime target for experimentation by scientists and technomancers. Powerful individuals with advanced training in both magic and science have unlocked the secrets of creating animated quartz swarms, often to serve as sentries that can perform their duties without the need for rest. Often integrated into traps, animated quartz swarms can suddenly turn beautifully decorated chandeliers, fountains, and other seemingly benign installations into deadly defenses when the swarms incorporated into these objects fly into action. Each crystal of an animated quartz swarm is a hexagonally cut gem 2 to 3 inches wide, sometimes with a tint of color. Each crystal must have runes painstakingly inscribed on its surface. A single crystal presents no threat at all, but a swarm of them can obliterate many would-be trespassers. Creatures that get stuck in the swarm&rsquo;s space soon learn that the piezoelectric properties of the quartz make it a dangerous place to be&mdash;as the whirling crystals alternately bludgeon and electrocute them.</p>\n<p>Animated quartz swarms don&rsquo;t occur naturally; they&rsquo;re always intentionally created. The runes on the crystals&rsquo; surfaces contain simple programs with instructions for the quartz swarms, typically defining a specific area to defend or a password or visual sign by which they can identify authorized individuals.</p>\n<p>Shimreens (Alien Archive 3 96), crystalline humanoids from the planet Shimrinsara, are the first documented creators of animated quartz swarms. So advanced were these early swarms that the individual quartz crystals didn&rsquo;t require inscribed runes; shimreens could simply issue commands to the quartz. Legend has it that the very first, albeit tiny, animated quartz swarm utilized pieces derived from the inventor&rsquo;s crystalline crown, left over from when she changed her appearance. Many expensive homes and corporate buildings in Shimrinsara&rsquo;s domed cities have an animated quartz swarm somewhere on the premises, ready to defend the property. Visitors to Shimrinsara observed the ever-vigilant sentries and word quickly spread about the swarms, leading to researchers throughout the galaxy developing similar techniques for animating quartz. However, these secondhand methods require the time-consuming step of inscribing runes on hundreds or even thousands of crystals to program the swarm, though magic can speed up the process. Shimreens initially objected to their technology being replicated by outsiders, but the swarms&nbsp;have proven so useful that their manufacture still spread rapidly; shimreens have since largely grown resigned to the appropriation and object only to having outside societies&rsquo; swarms brought onto Shimrinsara. Other societies believe that shimreens&rsquo; animated quartz swarms are more powerful than those developed by anyone else, but shimreens don&rsquo;t sell their technology to outsiders and instead pursue anyone who attempts to steal one of their swarms.</p>\n<p>Vesk technomancers took to animated quartz swarms quickly, as the reptilian warriors can always use sentries that don&rsquo;t need food, water, or rest. They often add additional runes that prevent permanent deactivation by causing tampered-with crystals to explode, which sends shards of crystalline shrapnel to pelt whoever would dare destroy a vesk&rsquo;s animated quartz swarm. This explosive and potentially deadly modification is often looked down on as an excessive response, but their use isn&rsquo;t officially banned yet. AbadarCorp has several quartz swarm animators on its payroll, and rumor has it that each creator knows only a portion of the instructions to be inscribed for maximum possible security. Each creator fills in their section and then passes on the crystal to the next stage, which prevents anyone from knowing how to bypass&mdash;or recreate&mdash;the whole system.</p>\n<p>Animated quartz swarms aren&rsquo;t always programmed as guards, though that&rsquo;s certainly the most popular application. Other swarms help perform search-and-rescue missions in dangerous areas, vibrating rapidly to send a radio signal to their programmers when they find their objectives. The swarms are even sometimes used for aesthetics, such as being programmed to fly into complex patterns to accompany high-production concerts by musicians. This use does require a significant financial investment for the special effects, as only extremely talented creators can fabricate animated quartz swarms. The dangerous effects of an animated quartz swarm are typically engineered out for these alternate uses by using crystals with slightly different molecular structures that produce unique effects.</p>\n<p>Individual swarm creators tend to rely on particular sources for the quartz crystals used to construct their swarms, with varying hues and cuts for the gems. This practice tends to give swarms distinctive appearances that a clever detective can use to identify the creator. The manufacturers for the cut crystals typically agree not to sell the exact same design to anyone else.</p>\n<p>Some solarians have experimented with using inscribed crystals as weapon crystals, though to inconsistent results.

			"description": "<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Spectra, a race of outsiders native to the newly discovered hyperspace plane of the Drift, are unique in the Great Beyond as a relatively recent addition to the multiverse, rising in prominence over the last 300 years alongside the proliferation of Drift technology. Concerned primarily with the protection and promulgation of the nascent plane, and of advanced technology in general, spectra are beings of paradox and dichotomy. Some metaphysicians believe that, just as the Drift grows by pulling in pieces of the multiverse each time a starship uses it to travel, so too are spectra created—amalgamations of raw, sometimes opposing energies born from the stolen pieces of other planes. Yet spectra are also undeniably of the Drift itself. They have inherent resistance to magic and can slip in and out of the Drift via innate esoteric—though purely technological—means. Some theorists posit that, like the beacons that enable travel through the Drift, spectra somehow exist simultaneously in multiple planes, manifesting in only one at any given time. Spectra rarely speak using their own voices, which are a mix of low-fidelity synthesized tones. They prefer to use their machine telepathy to temporarily harness nearby communication technology, speaking using a starship’s intercom or causing text to appear on a vidscreen, for instance.<br><br>Iridias are one of the few spectra encountered outside the Drift, most often on the Material Plane. Averaging 6 feet tall with opalescent skin and a coil of glistening rainbow light for hair, iridias serve as messengers and ambassadors to species of all planes, evangelizing the benefits of advanced technology and enforcing the tripartite will of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}. Iridias have been known to visit remote worlds in the Vast where @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}’s original signal containing the secrets of Drift travel were lost or suppressed, bringing with them instructions and a second chance to join the galactic community. They are also keen to see mortal technology continue to grow and advance—an interest that can put them at odds with societies that choose to limit technology’s influence, as well as others wary of sudden unfettered progress, such as the tekhoinos aeons.<br><br>Aspecnas, powerful spectra paragons with fan-like tails and faces that resemble blooming flowers, rarely interact directly with the Material Plane. These formidable outsiders instead concern themselves with maintaining the precarious balance of power among extraplanar forces in the Drift, opposing any who would attempt to establish strongholds with the intent of laying their own claim to a substantial expanse of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}’s realm. Aspecnas have on occasion appeared to correct the course of mortals who have become lost in the ever-shifting plane, and even intervened to protect weaker mortals from the predation of malevolent Drift-marooned outsiders. These rare but memorable acts have earned aspecnas the nickname “Drift angels” among those who regularly travel through the plane.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (the Drift)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or triad (1 aspecna and 2 iridias)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

		"Assembly Ooze": {
			"name": "Assembly Ooze",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Thought to have been created on the planet Bretheda as a biotechnological replacement for automation processes, assembly oozes are essentially cores of nanobots suspended within blobs of animated protoplasm. As the ooze absorbs raw materials, the nanobots work at the molecular level to turn that matter into a functioning technological device, the blueprints of which have been entered into the machines’ original programming.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Due to sloppy programming procedures, the code embedded within an assembly ooze has an unfortunate tendency to easily become corrupted, causing the ooze to haphazardly deconstruct any nearby tech and use the pieces to build random items. The first time this occurred, several assembly oozes escaped the ensuing purge and built copies of themselves, eventually spreading to various shadowy corners of the galaxy. While these rogue oozes are not all that dangerous and have no innate malice, they are the bane of space stations, starships, weapon depots, and anywhere else technology is present. When discovered in such a location, assembly oozes are ruthlessly exterminated, lest their nonstop disassembling of all things mechanical and electronic destroy critical systems-to say nothing of the new, potentially lethal devices left in their wake. While assembly oozes are still used in some factories on Bretheda and its more toxic moons, their use is highly regulated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>An assembly ooze resembles a human-sized, silvery cube, though its amorphous form allows it to slip through incredibly small openings. As it moves, surging forward on its pseudopods, random scraps the ooze has already collected sometimes float near the creature’s surface before quickly disappearing into its form. Entirely focused on absorbing and reshaping any available technology, assembly oozes usually ignore organic matter, living or otherwise, unless threatened. However, should a creature have mechanical or cybernetic elements attached to or incorporated into its physical form, an assembly ooze could very well cause that creature incidental harm in its attempts to harvest the technological parts. Sentient robots are extremely wary of assembly oozes, as their entire bodies could be targeted for processing into raw resources.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every so often, an assembly ooze holding its maximum number of virtual UPBs undergoes a form of mitosis, manufactures an identical copy of its computerized core, and splits its protoplasm into two equal parts. The nanobots of the two new assembly oozes then use the remaining virtual UPBs to build enough protoplasm to form an assembly ooze’s normal cube shape. This process usually takes about 1 hour and consumes all of the parent ooze’s virtual UPBs. That assembly oozes contain the programming necessary to reproduce is troubling to those who realize its implications: a single rogue assembly ooze introduced into an environment stocked with technological items could completely overrun such a place in a matter of days, leaving behind a wasteland of cheap laser pistols and smoke grenades that is inhabited only by the oozes-and any remaining organic beings unfortunate enough to be stranded in the area after their vessels are consumed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In some cases, certain unscrupulous types have used assembly oozes as weapons. If slipped into a starship or military base, a manufactory of assembly oozes can easily cause enough chaos to allow an operative to sneak in and complete her mission with very little opposition. However, this is also highly risky to the would-be saboteur, as even one misplaced assembly ooze could render her escape vessel inoperative. Assembly oozes can be temporarily incapacitated by strong electrical fields and kept at bay by mystical force fields, but anyone restraining an assembly ooze must be constantly vigilant and stay out of reach of the ooze’s pseudopod.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A single assembly ooze can craft handheld objects, but some claim to have seen assembly oozes working together to construct entire starships and other large and complex machinery. Where these oozes received their programming is unknown, as is whether such oozes have a master directing their efforts or if they have gained a collective sentience and are working for their own mysterious purposes. Nevertheless, most engineers agree that, given enough raw material and enough time, there is no technological item a directed horde of assembly oozes couldn’t build, putting it together piece by piece.<br/><br/><br/><br/>An assembly ooze is a cube exactly 5 feet on each side that weighs 400 pounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

		"Asteray": {
			"name": "Asteray",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>When humanoids first learned to ply the seas and oceans on Golarion, they encountered many beautiful and dangerous beings who cavorted in the waves and lured their vessels onto the rocks with enchanting songs. In time, they learned to differentiate the playful mermaid, the cruel rusalka, the bloodthirsty scylla, and their kin, and with that knowledge, the damage these strange beings could inflict was minimized. But when humanoids blasted into the stars, they found a new array of mischievous, mysterious creatures that threatened to lead their vessels into danger. Chief among these threats is the wily asteray.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Delicate and angelic looking in zero gravity, asterays are a race of vacuumdwelling fey that ride the solar winds between space debris, asteroid belts, and planetary rings, playing in the dust, dancing in microgravity, and seeking new and beautiful sights. Their bodies consist of little beyond lightweight, flexible bones and the powerful sinews that bind them together, creating a vaguely humanoid upper body and a lower body consisting of a large appendage that absorbs cosmic radiation and grants the fey the ability to propel itself through space. With elegant forms and diaphanous tails, they appear gentle and welcoming. Wide eyes-blue or green in color-express a variety of emotions, though apart from their eyes and the long, thin slit for a mouth, asterays have featureless faces. They are well adapted to life in the void, with sensitive vision, a variety of natural spells, and the capability to generate powerful bolts of electricity to defend themselves. They are also ravenous beyond compare. While space dust and solar radiation carry just enough nourishment to fuel their antics, asterays hunger for organic molecules. They pause their endless dances to scour asteroids and explore wrecked ships for sustenance. When food grows too scarce or boredom overwhelms them, asterays crawl into the dark corners of space and hibernate for weeks, months, or years at a time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Often called “deep angels” for their habit of following ships through the vastness of space to scavenge any discarded treats and pick hulls clean of organic stowaways, asterays can also become menaces. The electronic signals they produce to communicate with one another mimic the sensor signals emitted by most starships, and in the eons that planet-bound creatures have explored their territory, asterays have learned to “sing” false sensor signals, mimicking ships’ distress signals or cloaking navigational hazards such as high-density debris fields. Individual asterays are a danger only to smaller spacefaring vessels, but several working in tandem can lure even well-equipped warships to their doom thanks to their inherent magic. While few of these fey are cruel enough to hunt humanoids for food, they hold few qualms about eating whatever remains after a frightened crew ejects from a incapacitated starship, including the corpses of any fallen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Asterays originally spawned in those few magic-rich star systems where the First World naturally overlapped with the void. For eons, they remained confined to these backwater systems, unable to reach inhabited areas within their lifetimes, but the first mortal vessels to explore space provided the fey an exit. Asterays can ride the cosmic wakes of starships, regardless of their speed, hitchhiking on these explorers like remoras on a shark, and for much the same purpose. Today, most settled star systems boast at least a small colony of the capricious fey. Their domains are often in spots that have easy access to major space lanes, and they are marked by large cave-pocked asteroids where the asterays build their nests and hoard treasures. Wrecked ships invariably float through these spaces, often serving as new navigational hazards the fey either cloak with their sensor songs or use as tempting targets to lure in greedy scavengers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While not inherently malicious, asterays are alien in mind and deed. They understand that most creatures need air, water, and food, but they have difficulty prioritizing others’ needs over their own hunger and amusement. Much of their apparent cruelty and greed stems from this alien mindset and boredom; thus, those travelers who can amuse them or compel some level of empathy stand to gain powerful allies in the void.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A typical asteray is about 7-1/2 feet from its head to the end of its tail, though it could appear quite shorter if its lower appendage becomes bunched up or twisted. An average asteray weighs only 75 pounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Flitting among the stars and zipping between worlds, tritidairs resemble violetskinned children with antennae and darkpurple butterfly wings dotted with pinpoints of glowing light. These outsiders are constantly cheerful, frequently playing pranks and making jokes, but their good humor belies a great deal of power. Tritidairs have a deep connection to the nuclear fusion that powers stars, giving them their star-related abilities. Their eyes twinkle with starlight that can fascinate some viewers, so they keep their eyes covered with stylish goggles to prevent accidental exposure. Travelers in starships occasionally spot the unmistakable purple streak of light as a tritidair flies past.<br /><br />Tritidairs are devoted servants of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna} and frequently travel to Cynosure, the pole star and home of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna}&rsquo;s palace. @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna}n priests say that the goddess planted a seed in a new star, which shot forth light that became the first tritidair. Although this origin story might be apocryphal, what is certain is that the birth of every new star creates a tritidair. They don&rsquo;t remain near their stars of origin for long, but each tritidair has a unique pattern of glowing dots on their butterfly wings corresponding to the locations of the stars where and when they were born.<br /><br />These outsiders serve as messengers and pages for the Song of the Spheres, running errands for her throughout the galaxy. Although their starlight form enables interplanar travel, this method of travel has its limits. Tritidairs explain that not every star can provide passage-some are broken-but the concept is difficult to describe to others. Still, tritidairs can move quickly over vast distances to convey messages or provide aid to followers and allies of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna} who find themselves in trouble.<br /><br />Tritidairs are fiercely loyal. The kindhearted and impulsive creatures don&rsquo;t seek out combat, nor does @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna} commonly send them on missions involving violence. If pushed into combat, particularly if required to protect innocents, they are very willing to use spells and weapons to deal deadly damage. All tritidairs carry easily identifiable starknives patterned with constellations matching those on their wings. These magical starknives charge with energy each time the tritidair travels between stars. Many @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna}ns carry copies of these knives. Some who have interacted with a tritidair engrave such starknives with constellation patterns matching the wings of that tritidair as a way to honor and remember the azata, much like carving a dear friend&rsquo;s name on a personal treasure.<br /><br />These azatas lack sexual characteristics, but some tritidairs choose a gender, and many favor the feminine, mimicking their goddess. They enjoy art, music, and theater, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon for a major performance to have a tritidair or two in attendance. When tritidairs meet in larger groups, they often enjoy playing games and sports. However, tritidairs don&rsquo;t have permanent residences or family units, and they don&rsquo;t stay in one place for long.<br /><br />Tritidairs sometimes linger on Cynosure or in Elysium, but most prefer to remain on the Material Plane. They genuinely enjoy the company of mortals, and when not on assignments from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna}, tritidairs travel, alone or in small groups, to random planets or starships, where the azatas look for new friends and adventures. Because of this tritidair spirit of exploration, many species on various worlds have myths and stories of flying star children.<br /><br />Although tritidairs spread the worship of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna}, their primary motivations are to meet new creatures and have fun experiences. They aren&rsquo;t the most reliable when called upon by anyone but @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna}, but nevertheless, some creatures and organizations successfully form alliances with tritidairs. Solarians and tritidairs can feel a connection to one another, given their mutual association with the stars.<br /><br />Tritidairs don&rsquo;t age, and some have outlived the birth and death of stars. A tritidair can survive the destruction of its star of origin, and similarly the demise of a tritidair has no discernible effect on the star. Tritidairs also don&rsquo;t require sleep, but they engage in long meditations to dream. Not only do they find the experience amusing, but @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna} can also speak with them through their dreams, sending the tritidairs their missions.<br /><br />Other creatures sleeping or engaging in similar deep rest near a meditating tritidair can find their dreams invaded by vivid visions from the azatas. Many who have such experiences report that their dreams never go back to normal, remaining rich and dramatic, but seldom troubling. Worshipers of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna} sometimes seek out tritidairs, hoping to earn this experience.<br /><br />Such seekers also hope to have visions of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna}, such as those who have been blessed with tritidair-influenced dreams have claimed to receive. These assertions can be true-@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna} can use the neural pathways a tritidair&rsquo;s influence opens to communicate with other beings likely to aid the goddess&rsquo;s aims. Good-hearted dreamers find themselves becoming more spontaneous and venturesome, looking for opportunities to explore and help others. With this increase in boldness comes an increase in apparent luck, although what seems to be luck is just as likely to be an increased awareness of good opportunities and the willingness to seize them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Elysium)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or flight (3-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>While tools and technology are often considered neutral in their own right, able to be used for good or ill purposes depending on the natures of their wielders, some good-aligned deities have long preached caution regarding those technologies that can allow single individuals to cause great havoc. The ascension of the artificially intelligent god @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}, who now holds technology and artificial life as its domains, has not eased such fears. Despite @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}’s claim of neutrality, the ubiquity of technology throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond has spurred many divine powers to keep careful watch over both the ways in which current technology is employed as well as rapid technological progress that could threaten all life.<br/><br/>As angels have always been the messengers and enactors of the gods’ will, a particular order of angelic beings, known as barachiuses, oversees technological advances and ensures these creations don’t fall into the wrong hands or become twisted to serve evil gods and their minions. Outfitted with divinely blessed armor, weapons, and abilities, barachius angels are tasked with monitoring the planes both to protect mortal existence from technology gone awry and to quash technologically advanced cultures that present an explicit threat to all good creatures and causes. While all angels might be expected to protect the innocent from harm, barachiuses specialize in defending against subtle technological threats that might go unnoticed by the rank-and-file troops of the celestial legions. When a rapidly developing AI suddenly veers into true evil, when a new invention threatens to destroy countless innocents, when Hell’s hacker devils feed insidious viruses into mortal mainframes-these are when barachiuses truly shine.<br/><br/>A barachius is an imposing figure, standing in what appears to be sleek, glowing armor and wielding a sword that pulses with the light of the stars or a glowing laser rifle. Its wings appear to be made of pure electricity, though a closer look reveals patterns within the feathery arcs that mimic digital arrays and computer wiring. Its face is often hidden behind an elaborate helm, and its voice-when it deigns to speak-is clipped and rapid-fire.<br/><br/>Yet a barachius’s true strength resides not within its presence or arms but in its near-prescient ability to understand the nature of any technological object or being that it encounters. Exactly how and why the angels deem some technology not just dangerous but immoral is a great mystery, as it’s not based solely on sheer destructive capacity. For instance, barachiuses have been known to hunt down and destroy individual robots with extreme determination while leaving similar models-and silos of nuclear missiles-entirely untouched.<br/><br/>A barachius might serve its purpose in a wide variety of ways. It could secretly patrol a settlement that is already rife with technology, constantly on the search for malicious computer code, machines run amok, or creatures bent on using technology for nefarious ends. Alternatively, one could be found searching for scientists and laboratories where cutting-edge research is being conducted. Even researchers with the best of intentions may come under the scrutiny of a barachius that deems the ongoing work or latest invention too threatening to the society’s ongoing moral health. Barachiuses also keep watch over some planets and species that lack advanced technology to ensure that they’re not enslaved or annihilated by races with greater resources-though again, why they perform this action for some races and not others is a mystery deeply vexing to scholars and mystics. Many believe their choices are based on an ability to see lines of probability stretching into the future and the angels’ need to make minor course corrections now and then to avoid catastrophe. Rarely, a barachius might take a more redemptive approach. Rather than destroying evil-aligned devices and technological life-forms, it might seek to turn a target to the path of good. Barachiuses minister to androids and robots in particular, hoping that merciful actions might inspire the artificial creatures to similar acts.<br/><br/>Barachius Helm<br/><br/>What looks like a magnificent helmet on a barachius is actually an extension of its being, and thus it can never be taken from it by force. On occasion, however, a barachius particularly impressed by a mortal might offer that champion a magical copy of its own helm that’s imbued with a sliver of its essence and grants the wearer some of its own power.<br/><br/>Extra Content<br/><br/>The following extra content was found for this creature:<br/><br/>- Angel (Creature Subtype) Graft Template<br/><br/>- Angel (Summoning) Graft Template</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any good-aligned planes</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

The first is their ability to rewrite their own genetic code instinctively and at will, adjusting their own biology to allow them to manufacture a huge array of substances&mdash;and even advanced biotechnology&mdash; within the crucibles of their own bodies. Yet while this ability makes them quite successful in the Pact Worlds economy, and has deeply influenced their culture&rsquo;s understanding of wealth and trade, their more notable adaptation is the ability to combine with others of their kind into larger, hive-minded superentities.

Young barathus who grow up surrounded by humanoids are an exception, as they are better able to appreciate the mindsets of creatures who exist in static, solitary configurations. Compared to older barathus, early stage barathus are more adventurous and individualistic, and their adaptation to the humanoid mindset makes it more difficult for them to merge completely with others of their kind. Most of these early stage barathus grow out of this phase, gaining the ability to fully integrate with others, yet recent generations have seen more and more barathus deliberately clinging to their juvenile mindsets. While plenty of barathus remain discrete entities for most of their lives, barathus nearing the ends of their lives often merge with massive, permanent combinatory entities that serve as corporations, governments, or cultural repositories.</p>\n</section>"

The first is their ability to rewrite their own genetic code instinctively and at will, adjusting their own biology to allow them to manufacture a huge array of substances&mdash;and even advanced biotechnology&mdash; within the crucibles of their own bodies. Yet while this ability makes them quite successful in the Pact Worlds economy, and has deeply influenced their culture&rsquo;s understanding of wealth and trade, their more notable adaptation is the ability to combine with others of their kind into larger, hive-minded superentities. These mergings create not merely amalgams of their component beings, but entirely new entities with unique and independent consciousnesses, yet which in turn often disband back into their component individuals after a particular need or threat has passed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Barathu culture tends to be easygoing but hard for some other races to understand, as the barathus&rsquo; frequent merging makes the concept of &ldquo;self&rdquo; somewhat nebulous to them. Young barathus who grow up surrounded by humanoids are an exception, as they are better able to appreciate the mindsets of creatures who exist in static, solitary configurations. Compared to older barathus, early stage barathus are more adventurous and individualistic, and their adaptation to the humanoid mindset makes it more difficult for them to merge completely with others of their kind. Most of these early stage barathus grow out of this phase, gaining the ability to fully integrate with others, yet recent generations have seen more and more barathus deliberately clinging to their juvenile mindsets. While plenty of barathus remain discrete entities for most of their lives, barathus nearing the ends of their lives often merge with massive, permanent combinatory entities that serve as corporations, governments, or cultural repositories.</p>\n</section>"

However, legend says the goddess of monsters, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.yBvXrkYL2vAbRCS4]{Lamashtu}, freed the first barghests from the kennels of Hell. The greatest among them still live in a section of the Abyss they claim as their territory. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.SvZm3xijwqis2qDS]{Goblin} belief holds that the strongest of these barghests helped create goblinkind in time immemorial. Evil goblins, therefore, revere barghests as wicked hero-gods.<br/><br/>These fiends hunt and kill good-hearted humanoids to feed on the spiritual energy left within the corpses of such foes. Although a barghest might slay the innocent or weak, and even eat such prey, it gains the growth-inducing nourishment it seeks only from worthy opponents. Barghests commit atrocities to attract the attention of such would-be champions before murdering and devouring them, growing in size, magical power, and social standing with each success.<br/><br/>Masters of deception, barghests can transform into goblinoids or wolves at will. They use such forms to remain beneath notice to travel incognito or until ready to pounce. A typical barghest is 6 feet long and weighs 200 pounds. When it gains power, a barghest also gains size. The mightiest among them are twice the size of their lesser kin.</p>"

		"Bloodbrother": {
			"name": "Bloodbrother",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Usually confined to the glaciers that float upon the seas of Darkside-the side of tidally locked @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} that’s always turned away from the sun and thus never feels its heat- the abominations known as bloodbrothers hunt smaller creatures for their vital essences.<br/><br/>Measuring over 15 feet tall and 11 feet long, a bloodbrother looks like a millipede or some other armored, wormlike arthropod from the waist down. Its upper half resembles that of a muscular humanoid with a set of bony appendages protruding from a cavity in its chest. This ersatz rib cage can open like a fanged mouth, and when a bloodbrother places captured prey within it, the bones clamp down on the creature while the walls of the enclosure exude thin tendrilous suckers. These suckers tap into the prey’s circulatory system. Rather than simply drinking its blood, though, the bloodbrother uses the trapped creature as an auxiliary heart, absorbing blood-borne nutrients and using the prey’s metabolism to help it heat and feed itself. Prey can be kept alive in this way for months, until all its stored energy has been used up and the bloodbrother lets the lifeless husk fall to the ground.<br/><br/>A bloodbrother that hasn’t fed in a long time is almost sheer white, its chitinous exterior drying out and splitting like the husk of a coconut into hairlike fibers-the better to hold on to snow and disguise the creature for its ambushes. Once it’s successfully implanted a victim, however, its body takes on a purplish hue as it has rejuvenated with the flow of blood and vital fluids, while its fibrous hair lies back down and seals itself into smooth scales once more. This renewed appearance lasts for as long as the bloodbrother holds a victim and for several weeks thereafter.<br/><br/>Bloodbrothers’ gruesome feeding habits mean that intelligent creatures with any knowledge of the magical beasts usually flee from them or kill them on sight. However, a hungry bloodbrother’s fur is too stringy to be used as a pelt, and its meat tastes foul, meaning that hunting them provides nothing but a sense of bravado. As a result, the bloodbrother population on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} has remained steady-and luckily small-for millennia. Their need for regular victims in an environment hostile to most life means that bloodbrothers usually live alone, though they may occasionally gather into small packs called clans. Even during times when prey is scarce, these bloodbrothers don’t cannibalize one another. Instead, they migrate toward more inhabited areas, fearlessly taking on overwhelming odds if it means refreshing the blood in their veins.<br/><br/>Despite their name-a moniker assigned to them not by themselves but by humanoid Vercites-bloodbrothers have no sense of gender, and they reproduce asexually. At a certain point in a bloodbrother’s life, a handful of small, furry nodules appears along its spine. Biologists disagree on the exact conditions that cause this; some believe it is a rise in temperature, while others posit that reproduction requires specific nutrients in the blood of the creature’s most recent victim. As the months pass, the buds grow in size (and furriness) until they are about a foot across. Then, with a series of sickening squelches, these bulbs fall off the parent bloodbrother into the surrounding snow and ice. A few moments later, they uncurl into several immature bloodbrothers that are eager to entrap their first victims (usually tiny mammals or birds). In less than a year, a young bloodbrother reaches its full size and ferocity.<br/><br/>Despite their horrific and merciless nature, bloodbrothers are not mere beasts and are actually as intelligent as the average @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}. This facet of their nature is often overlooked due to both their lack of tool use and their apparent lack of interest in communication with other races. “Interest” is the operative word here, for while bloodbrothers have no language of their own, they appear to be able to understand those of others- they simply don’t care to speak. Communication with other members of a clan is conducted entirely through actions, physical touch, and some form of advanced intuition into the other’s needs, perhaps aided by pheromones or other signals not yet detected by researchers.<br/><br/>Bloodbrothers typically make their home in ice caves or stone caverns, patrolling the surrounding area for easy-to-capture prey. In the case of a clan, one member typically stays behind to protect the caves and any offspring therein, while those hunting return with an extra captive or two for them. When resting, the bloodbrothers slither onto one another to form one large pile. The blood-drained corpses of their pray lie scattered about the caves, eventually getting buried in the snow and ice, and trackers are quick to recognize a bloodbrother clan’s lair by the massive number of bones that can be found poking from the floor and walls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any cold (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or clan (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

Unlike most oozes, these slimes contain a complex yet amorphous neural network that enables learning, memory, and reasoning. These neurons can also integrate with a host’s nervous system, enabling nearly instantaneous communication between the two beings. Studies suggest the slimes replicate and absorb copies of their hosts’ neurons, so hypothetically, a prolific slime could grow smarter over time.<br/><br/>In most cases, though, a bodysnatcher slime never grows to occupy more than several cubic feet. Replicating neurons grants the slime greater control over its form, allowing it to grow and still coordinate its movements and metabolism. However, bigger oozes find it more difficult to fit inside hosts without causing the body to bulge such that it betrays the parasite’s presence. Furthermore, the slime’s modified neural network can develop multiple personalities that compete for resources and control. Ultimately, such a creature splits and forms two new slimes, each of which begins rebuilding the vast stores of knowledge and neurons that it lost in the process. Rarely, an ooze retains control over its growing mental prowess and so avoids splitting. These rare bodysnatcher autocrats selectively infest hosts they perceive as powerful.<br/><br/>As with humanoid brains, a slime’s neural network requires the slime to consume a large number of calories to sustain it While infesting a host, the slime draws its necessary nutrients from the host’s body and digestive system; this process adds a faintly citrus scent to the host’s sweat and excrement. However, without a host, a bodysnatcher slime can absorb nutrients from a wide variety of foods, favoring high-calorie options like sugars and flesh. When denied sustenance, the slime can enter hibernation, awaiting suitable prey for months at a time.<br/><br/>Bodysnatcher slimes aren’t malicious, but they are insidious. When spoken to, they are baffled by claims that abducting others is reprehensible. Given the oozes’ simple physiology and psychology, this mindset likely results from a lack of higher thought processes and capacity for self-reflection. However, bodysnatcher slimes grow increasingly ambitious the longer they spend in hosts and the larger they become, suggesting a moral compass doesn’t accompany greater intelligence.<br/><br/>Having stowed away on countless ships, the slimes have spread across the Pact Worlds, the Veskarium, and beyond.

When the dead planet @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox} suffered the cataclysm that nearly destroyed the world, its inhabitants looked to necromancy for their salvation. The most powerful elebrians became bone sages, but a significant proportion of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}’s populace that managed to survive did so as bone troopers. As a result, most bone troopers in the Pact Worlds are elebrians from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, recognizable by the elongated elebrian cranium.<br/><br/>The Corpse Fleet employs countless elebrian bone troopers, which far outnumber other undead in the exiled navy’s ranks. Most of these troopers are soldiers, although many specialize as operatives, technomancers, or mindbreaker mystics.<br/><br/>A bone trooper looks like a fleshless skeleton with a cold, cunning light burning in its eye sockets. Bone troopers wear normal clothing or armor and wield contemporary weapons.</p>"

			"name": "Brain Collector",
			"description": "<p>The hideous brain collectors, also known as neh-thalggus, originate from worlds beyond the known galaxy, and they belong to the hostile coalition called the Dominion of the Black. These creatures&rsquo; common name stems from their obsession with absorbing the brains of any being they deem inferior&mdash;in effect, virtually every other being&mdash; not to gain sustenance, but to increase their intellect and power their spells.</p>\n<p>Brain collectors resemble vaguely scorpion-like creatures with lamprey mouths, jagged pincers, and clattering legs studded with twitching eyes. Pulsating, brain-filled blisters line their backs, making these monstrous creatures easily distinguishable from other predators in the Vast. Those who survive encounters with brain collectors describe eerie, whispering thoughts intruding into their minds. These thoughts seem to simultaneously offer salvation and destruction, and some victims report that they couldn&rsquo;t determine whether the thoughts belonged to the brain collector, the pulsating brain sacs, or their own traumatized imaginations.</p>\n<p>Even after millennia of exposure to Pact Worlds species, brain collectors&rsquo; motivations remain murky; it remains unclear whether they act to fulfill the schemes of sinister overlords among the Dominion of the Black or if their hostility stems from an utterly incomprehensible morality, if not outright cruelty. Whatever the case, brain collectors are relentless. Upon landing on a planet in living drop-ships, their vessels rot into useless biological matter as well as metal components the brain collectors use to convert caves and abandoned buildings into unsettling, fleshwalled compounds. From these bases, the brain collectors systematically hunt, kill, and claim the brains of intelligent beings. Once satiated&mdash;which can take anywhere from a few days to many years, depending on their needs&mdash;the brain collectors rapidly disassemble their fleshy homes, reconstruct their shuttles, and return to their orbiting starships. They then set off for another distant world to repeat the process&mdash;or return their cerebral payload to their unknown home worlds.</p>\n<p>Largely solitary, brain collectors hunt alone even when sharing starships and lairs. The greatest emotional bond they form comes through brain-swapping, a grotesque process that allows them to share their victims&rsquo; memories. To a brain collector, other creatures simply serve as resources, with no more rights or dignity than their ships&rsquo; fuel. Even so, they regularly attract cults dedicated to the Dominion whose members harbor misguided hopes that obeisance might save the cultists&rsquo; lives. For the most part, neh-thalggus don&rsquo;t care for these cults, and the members have no guarantees of safety.</p>\n<p>Yet some brain collectors appear to take pleasure in being worshipped, even if it mostly just makes their jobs easier. A few unsubstantiated reports claim that neh-thalggus who consume the brains of zealous individuals can inadvertently absorb humanoid notions of faith, in turn developing uncharacteristic habits of grandiosity, generosity, or protectiveness. If these anomalies exist, it seems other brain collectors quickly eradicate the heretics.</p>\n<p>Xenoanthropologists&rsquo; research suggests that brain collectors&rsquo; religion venerates the primordial forces of space and time, potentially serving as the belief that unifies the species and drives their behavior. Others, however, believe that brain collectors simply &ldquo;practice&rdquo; religion out of boredom during their long journeys among the stars, and that they take it no more or less seriously than rote mathematics. However, an emerging theory proves among the most concerning: that over the eons they spent accumulating knowledge, brain collectors have discovered some fearful, fundamental truths of the universe&mdash;and only faith preserves them from abject terror.</p>\n<p>Brain collectors are among the most commonly encountered members of the Dominion of the Black, though they rarely interact or cooperate with others from that enigmatic group. However, they practically never enter into direct competition with one another. A common punishment for a scheming or inefficient brain collector involves violently tearing out their brain collection, then abandoning them on a lifeless moon to suffer centuries of stupefaction and powerlessness. According to unconfirmed rumors, brain collectors that excel at their duties undergo transformations to become far more powerful and horrific creatures.</p>\n<p>The average brain collector has a stature about 6 feet tall and 9 feet across; they can weigh over 3,500 pounds.</p>"

		"Bryrvath": {
			"name": "Bryrvath",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>For many creatures, light is a source of hope and healing, often associated with benevolent gods and their servants. For others, light is an abhorrence to be shunned at all costs, as it causes disorientation and pain, if not complete extermination, upon exposure. For adventurers, light can be an invaluable resource, guiding them through uncharted territory or acting as a beacon to draw them home after they have become lost in the darkness of space.<br/><br/>For bryrvaths, light is a plaything that they twist into an impossible spectrum. Dwelling primarily on the foreboding planet of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Ave5caJSxVvKFVAB]{Aucturn}, bryrvaths are a bane to creatures that use light for survival. A bryrvath appears to feed upon any source of light it can find, regardless of whether the light is natural, technological, or magical in origin. It can absorb light in its immediate vicinity, using the waves and packets of photons to nourish itself. Speculation endlessly spins around whether a bryrvath actually consumes light out of hunger or whether it seeks to snuff out light as a source of perverse pleasure. The truth may be utterly alien to any sane mind.<br/><br/>A bryrvath is difficult to describe because of the way its body interacts with light and darkness. Those who have seen a bryrvath and survived provide conflicting accounts of the creature. Cobbled together, these many tales tell of a multilimbed humanoid (some say two limbs, some say eight, while others say an infinite number) whose head is constantly masked by swirling shadows. At least one pair of its limbs ends in obsidian claws. Its body has several lipless gashes that open to draw in light. A bryrvath appears to have no actual skeletal structure, moving like rubber- sometimes upright, sometimes on all its limbs, and other times tumbling and clambering about in chaotic locomotion. Whenever it moves, its body seems somehow out of joint with itself: its limbs may appear detached in one moment, and then in the next, its entire torso may seem to split at an impossible angle, as if viewed through a pane of cracked glass, never quite aligning in a way that makes sense.<br/><br/>In the act of feeding, a bryrvath emanates a distorted aura of colors that can’t possibly exist in this multiverse; some who see this display have horrific dreams for the rest of their lives, envisioning alien cities or whole planets baking beneath a sun that blazes with hues no eye has ever seen. Oddly, such victims also display a tendency toward a mental condition that prevents them from properly recognizing color, rendering them fully color-blind.<br/><br/>Many occult scholars posit that what can be seen of a bryrvath’s form is only a fraction of its true self and that it exists simultaneously in several other dimensions. This theory goes on to explain that a bryrvath’s impossible aura is but a glimpse of the aberration’s other facets (hence the strange, mind-bending colors). The academics who put forth this hypothesis have yet to present any kind of proof, though they work tirelessly to fabricate the necessary detection equipment to prove or disprove the theory. This has given rise to an obscure branch of study called esoteric optics that blends the physics of light with various arcane rituals. Though not many in the Pact Worlds have heard of this field, it occasionally appears in news vidfeeds, such as when an expert is committed to a psychiatric hospital after splashing acid in his eyes and raving about “the impending refraction.”<br/><br/>While bryrvaths are very intelligent, they don’t appear to have an advanced society of any kind. They occasionally gather in small groups for unknown reasons, usually near a source of bright light, much in the way certain animals congregate around a watering hole. Also, despite their intelligence, bryrvaths have very little use for tools, as their unusual feeding needs don’t require them; they instead rely on their spell-like abilities and natural weapons to defend themselves.<br/><br/>The average bryrvath is 6 feet tall when standing upright and weighs approximately 250 pounds. While often found in areas that are primarily covered in darkness-presumably to plunge those who carry artificial light sources into terrible inky blackness-a bryrvath shows no fear of natural light, though it tends not to linger in areas exposed to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Ave5caJSxVvKFVAB]{Aucturn})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or canvas (3-7)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

		"Calecor": {
			"name": "Calecor",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>When a world suffers a global calamity-a tremendous loss of resident life-forms due to asteroid impact, rapid climate change, war, or other apocalyptic scenario-the ramifications can ripple far beyond that planet. In some cases, as the torrent of souls leaves the planet, bound for @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VQrVznzrr85I90TI]{Pharasma}’s Boneyard, some of the life energy from dying fey creatures and nonsentient organisms ripples back to the First World, tearing a hole in the fabric of the Material Plane. The essence of the First World surrounds and contains this blast of anguished energy, waves of planar force wrapping around it like an oyster making a pearl, until the two elements combine and solidify into a new entity, a calecor.<br/><br/>A calecor is the fey embodiment of the planetary disaster that birthed it-nature’s violent reaction to the cycle of birth, growth, evolution, and death being catastrophically and irreparably interrupted. Biologists and mystics are unsure why some disasters result in the creation of a calecor while others do not. After all, most planets suffer events that were disastrous for some and beneficial for others, and evolution itself kills off existing species through natural processes, such as when newly evolved trees absorb enough carbon dioxide from an atmosphere to cause global cooling. To date, the best theory is that the dying fey associated with a world’s biome have an innate sense of a planet’s natural order, a sort of racial memory for the planet as a whole. Therefore, only extinctions that this aggregate fey consciousness deems the work of outside actors trigger enough resentment to coalesce into a calecor.<br/><br/>Calecors not only take forms suiting their planet’s primary environments, but also have sphinx-like shapes, with the body of a hunting cat and great wings of overlapping leaves. A calecor’s body is formed not of flesh, but rather vines that wrap and twist around pieces of broken stone, such as rubble from a native civilization destroyed by the calamity. Instead of a head, the vines of the creature’s neck writhe up and cradle a holographic globe split down the middle into two pieces: a perfect, real-time representation of the calecor’s bonded world. A calecor is 10 feet tall and can weigh more than 6 tons.<br/><br/>Always encountered singly, calecors have little culture and might not even be aware of the existence of other calecors. As soon as a calecor emerges into consciousness, its first action is to leave the First World and travel back through the planar breach to the world whose death spawned it. Once there, it does everything in its power to undo the damage and reset the ecosystem to a stable state, magically tearing down the structures of those it deems responsible for the tragedy and terraforming regions too blasted to support life. So deep is the calecor’s bond to its planet that it instinctively knows everything happening on or within it, and it is able to see and hear events on the other side of the world just by thinking about it.<br/><br/>Instinctively able to speak any language, a calecor’s mind is nevertheless as broken as the globe that forms its head, its mind split between painful visions of the past and the overwhelming desire to heal and nurture. Those who attempt to make psychic contact with the creatures report a devastating, disorienting whirlwind of different thoughts-the death cries of a billion organisms-and such contact can seriously harm those who lack superior mental fortitude.<br/><br/>Although not inherently bellicose, and in fact gentle toward organisms it deems in need of recovery or repopulation, a calecor has no patience for those who would despoil its world or oppose its mission. In such situations, interlopers might be warned off with painful visions of the terrifying apocalypse that led to the calecor’s birth. If that tactic doesn’t work, a calecor shifts gravity to keep foes @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.QnGpBSHSTiszjPSb]{Off-Kilter} while it picks them off, breaking minds and disintegrating bodies until the threat is neutralized. Those who can convince the calecor that their goals align, however, might find themselves with the most powerful ally on the planet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

The unusual cells in its skin allow a cargo creep to mimic any sort of material with uncanny accuracy, almost down to its molecular structure.

Rarely, one of the creatures develops a taste for the substance, after feeding on the ichor directly from the planet or feeding on an orocoran (Alien Archive 90) fat on the fluid. The ichor makes carrion wheels especially powerful, cunning, and aggressive. These so-called &ldquo;ichor wheels&rdquo; forgo burrowing for a more mobile lifestyle. As they feast, ichor wheels seem to enjoy collecting souvenirs (sometimes valuable treasures, but more often leftover bones and viscera) that they adhere to their bodies in a macabre expression of individuality.

			"name": "Caypin",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Caypins are some of the most insidious creatures to inhabit the galaxy’s marshes. Although they are hulking beasts, their physiques somewhere between those of wolves and crocodiles, they’re best known for the strange, detachable tentacles that contain both their eyes and their mouths. These eyestalks are able to wriggle like eels both on land and in water, and they can travel up to 100 feet from their “host,” allowing the caypin to both hunt and keep eyes on its territory-literally- while still lurking safely out of sight, often underwater. While the tentacles are capable of transmitting information back to their caypin via poorly understood psychic phenomena, the tentacles are relatively weak on their own and generally return to their host or gather together in groups before engaging with prey or intruders. In marshy areas where caypins are known to hunt, only the foolish wade into water without first checking to make sure that no fat, vermian tentacles with tiny mouths lurk nearby.<br/><br/>Caypins live on multiple planets throughout the galaxy and are most plentiful on worlds that support extensive swamps or marshes full of meaty prey. Contrary to most people’s assumptions, caypins are not naturally evil-their limited intellects are incapable of truly understanding moral questions at all-but they are apex predators singularly driven by an insatiable hunger for huge amounts of raw meat. Caypins tend to eat half of their body weight in meat every few days, chewing away at the corpses of prey with their dozens of tiny mouths, and more than a few planets have seen native populations of slow-moving mammals, flightless birds, or languid amphibians go extinct due to caypins’ voracious hunting patterns. Likely for this reason, caypins typically live and hunt alone, although occasionally a mated pair shares a single swamp that both use as a killing field. Caypins typically live several hundred years or longer. However, caypins that cannot regularly feed fall into torpor, sometimes sleeping for years at a time in the muck of a river bottom before awakening with a driving hunger.<br/><br/>Caypin biology is as fascinating as it is terrifying, as scholars from both universities and private industry have all so far failed to identify the mechanism by which its detachable appendages communicate with the main body. The wolf-shaped body of a caypin has no eyes or mouth of its own-rather, it sees and eats only via the contributions of dozens of thick, stalk-like appendages that hang from a jawlike protrusion on the front of their skulls. Each appendage bears a bloodshot eyeball looming over a tiny mouth with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth. While their stalks are attached to their jaws, caypins feed normally, with the tiny mouth-tentacles passing along nutrients through a receptive socket in the jaw. Yet these tentacles can also detach and hunt independently, swarming over unwitting creatures, stripping the victims of meat, and carrying the masticated nourishment back to the caypin’s body. Once reattached, these appendages inject the meat into the feeding sockets to be digested as normal. Caypins can drink without the aid of their feeding appendages, ingesting water directly through the tentacles’ attachment sockets. Lacking digestive organs of their own, these tentacles are reliant on the main body to refresh the nutrients in their blood. Whether this strange system is the result of two symbiotic creatures having evolved to rely on each other or a single creature evolving a curious trait remains anyone’s guess. While many biologists believe the caypin’s control of its tentacles is the result of some unknown (and so far untraceable) form of psychic magic, others posit that the caypin’s nervous system relies on quantum entanglement, thus removing any need for physical connection. Either way, many corporations would love to uncover the secret of the caypin’s instantaneous, untraceable communication.<br/><br/>Occasionally, a caypin’s stalks are destroyed during a difficult hunt. In these cases, the caypin is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blind} and cannot eat for 3 days while its appendages regrow. A caypin that has lost its feeding appendages typically hides and avoids interacting with other living beings, but if startled or cornered, it may go into a frenzy, attacking anything near it, though its blindness makes it a much less formidable opponent than it would be normally.<br/><br/>Most xenobiologists consider caypins an invasive species that likely originated somewhere in the Veskarium, given the reptilian people’s admiration for the beasts. Some powerful vesk have managed to train caypins and keep them as pets, and have been known to intentionally import them to worlds they conquer. However, given caypins’ prevalence on planets that have had no known contact with the vesk, it’s likely that caypins or variations thereof evolved along parallel routes on several worlds. Caypins’ superficial biology supports this theory-caypins on different worlds often have somewhat divergent physiologies, and caypins with dramatically different abilities likely await discovery.<br/><br/>A typical caypin is 14 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any swamp</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

Cephalumes predominantly live in the middle strata of these methane seas, a lightless expanse with no discernible ground or sky. Cephalumes have cephalopod-like bodies with a prominent head and a large single foot. Their skin is naturally bioluminescent, and cephalumes flicker this light to communicate in Lumos, a visual language comprised of sequential, carefully timed blinks. As a result, most cephalume clothing and armor incorporate transparent force fields to allow light to shine through.<br/><br/>Cephalumes form symbiotic unions with small bioelectric arthropods known as krikiks. These symbiotes can communicate with their hosts in a tactile variant of Lumos that uses soft electrical pulses. Krikiks have significantly longer life spans than cephalumes do, and they are sometimes gifted from cephalume to cephalume as heirlooms. Cephalumes can bond with multiple krikiks as they age, though such a distinction is reserved for respected cephalumes of high station.<br/><br/>Cephalume culture is subtle and traditional, valuing community, curiosity, and exploration. Cephalumes engage in a unique form of ancestor worship, and the buildings in their settlements are actually the calcified remains of their @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}, often the only solid structures to be found in the aquatic void they live in. Many cephalumes continue to regard these edifices as the people they once were, and even hold conversations with them to talk out their problems in times of stress.<br/><br/>Like most other civilizations, cephalumes achieved spaceflight at some point during the Gap and now embark on celestial walkabouts across the galaxy. They strive to learn about the technologies and cultures of other civilizations before they return to Luminar, adding their discoveries to the collective knowledge of their people. Cephalume starships, like their buildings, are made from the remains of their @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}.

When a chomurk first lands on an asteroid, space station, or similarly small astronomical body, it immediately begins devouring anything it can find, preferring organic matter but eating metals or stone if necessary. If provided with sufficient material, it can reproduce asexually in a matter of hours, giving birth to a clone that grows to adult size in a day. The hive continues to mindlessly eat and reproduce, at which point some individuals begin melding their bodies together to create a “thruster-mound.” Guarded by nonmerged chomurks, the thruster-mound begins pushing the celestial object into a decaying orbit toward the nearest sun at exceptional speeds. As they approach the star, the nonmerged chomurks absorb solar radiation that both empowers and mutates them, creating genetic diversity. At the last minute, those chomurks launch themselves off their temporary home, scattering back out into space, where they hibernate until running across a new object and beginning the process again. Those chomurks incorporated into the thruster-mound are willingly sacrificed in the fires of the sun-along with any remaining residents of the hijacked celestial body.<br/><br/>Chomurks resemble 8-foot-long, 2,000-pound isopods, with colorful articulated shells and two sets of mandibles arranged in a cross shape. A ridge running down their back ends at a cylindrical protrusion with a rear-facing orifice-this is their biothruster, capable of releasing astonishingly powerful blasts of focused flame and force.

However, the bone sages of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox} have learned to magically repair even badly damaged corpses and those decayed beyond what was usable for lesser necromancers. As a result, corpsefolk make up much of the population of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, some serving as indentured servants to pay off the cost of their creation. Undead creatures of this type were called zombie masters in ancient days, but as a class of normal citizens on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox} and soldiers in the Corpse Fleet, they have become known as corpsefolk, balancing their humble social status with their self-willed mentality. Corpsefolk look like zombies, but unlike those undead, corpsefolk retain memories of their previous lives, skills and abilities gained from classes and experience, and the will to make their own decisions. Initially, a corpsefolk’s physical form looks gaunt and dry, with sunken eyes and a hollow torso, but it begins as intact as its corpse was when it gained undeath.<br/><br/>As corpsefolk age, however, their bodies can become torn and tattered. Early in their undead years, corpsefolk use surgery and magic to adopt a more wholesome appearance, but after a few decades, most cease to care what they look like, focusing only on what they can do to increase their long-term wealth and power. Corpsefolk can benefit from cybernetic implants, though many prefer necrografts, which blend more seamlessly with their animated forms.<br/><br/>Most living creatures see corpsefolk as walking corpses and as such fear or mistrust them, but other self-aware undead creatures treat corpsefolk as second-class undead. Bone sages view corpsefolk as barely better than zombies, while ghouls, vampires, and other undead treat them as peasants or wage slaves unworthy of respect. Because most corpsefolk exist as a result of being created specifically to serve, few enter their undead existence with wealth, power, or influence. Most corpsefolk also lack innate magic power or special abilities. Though they can learn and excel with time and practice, doing so is no easier for them than for living creatures. This fact, coupled with the prejudices they face, makes it difficult for corpsefolk to rise into important positions. @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, for instance, has a vast corpsefolk underclass, and these ragged undead are rarely selected for any position calling for interaction with living citizens of the Pact Worlds.<br/><br/>Corpsefolk can be found in various roles in those societies that accept them: managers, soldiers, technicians, and workers. They can use equipment they mastered in life and gain new skills, though they vary in their ambition. Some corpsefolk lack the drive to do more than the minimum needed to maintain their existence, which is very little. Unlike undead that must consume materials from the living or those that hate the living and wish to destroy them, corpsefolk have no supernatural hunger or drive to kill. They don’t need air, food, sleep, or water, and the more apathetic corpsefolk also don’t need stimuli-when left alone, they can sit in silence for weeks or years with no sense of boredom or unease.

Discarded shipping containers proved to be fine homes for them, earning the taekahbs their common name, since they can use such abodes to hide in plain sight.

		"Crest-Eater": {
			"name": "Crest-Eater",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Terrifying predators that roam the deserts and canyons of Kasath, crest-eaters earned their moniker thanks to their highly specialized diets: the hulking beasts feed almost exclusively on bone, and when attacking kasathas, they usually tear the humanoids’ heads from their bodies and then quickly and messily devour the bony crests within. A crest-eater has an advanced metabolism that processes the minerals it consumes to grow a large protrusion-a cross between antlers and a shell-from the crest-eater’s head and back. This outgrowth isn’t just made out of bone, however; it contains tiny fragments of reflective compounds that act like thousands of solar panels, thus providing the remainder of the nutrients the crest-eaters need to survive. As they age, the beasts grow more and more elaborate protrusions, increasing their surface area in order to store reserves of minerals for lean times. Crest-eaters also produce a venom that liquefies minerals, which can strip natural deposits of these resources from nearby rocks as easily as it melts the bones of their prey.<br/><br/>Crest-eaters have a muscular frame supported by four stout legs. The claws on a crest-eater’s legs are somewhat blunt, having evolved for scrabbling over rocks. A pair of thick limbs attached to the creature’s lower back area can function as another pair of legs, allowing it to easily navigate rocky terrain or distribute its bulk on shifting sands. However, the sharper claws on these extra appendages are mainly used for tearing through its prey’s flesh to reach the bones. A crest-eater’s vicious teeth are capable of delivering painful bites and injecting its devastating venom. Despite its rather reptilian appearance, the crest-eater shares many similarities to mammals, including a steady body temperature and the ability to bear live young.<br/><br/>Just as their biology skirts the edge of reptilian standards, so too does crest-eaters’ behavior. They are exceptionally social and loving animals, forming small prides of unrelated adults to hunt prey, dig out mineral deposits, and guard one another while they sleep. Many bold young hunters have fallen after slaying a single crest-eater, only to find its halfdozen compatriots rising from the sand around them. Cresteaters give birth to one or two young after a long pregnancy, during which the female grows increasingly ravenous for flesh and water, and an entire pride may take to hunting and aggressively defending water sources to feed a single pregnant mother’s needs. Newborn crest-eaters can dissolve bones immediately, though they are cautious predators until they begin to grow their first antler-shell around 1 year later.<br/><br/>Crest-eaters that grow up in close proximity to other creatures often form close bonds with them, and thus they can be found traveling with small crowds of scavengers that pick parasites off their protrusions and snatch up any kills the mighty hunters leave behind. Despite the creatures’ social nature, especially large males become increasingly aggressive as they age and are often driven from their prides and the most reliable sources of food. Though a bit past their prime, these crest-eaters are still very dangerous, and they usually become unpredictable loners that attack desert communities without fear. It sometimes takes the collective effort of several heroes to either put down or drive off one of these wild beasts. Such an endeavor is rarely accomplished without casualties or major injuries.<br/><br/>Crest-eaters occupy a place of fear and reverence in distant kasathan history. The humanoids’ ancient ancestors saw the beasts as terrifying messengers of death, particularly because of their tendency to rip off a victim’s head and leave the remainder of the body unmolested. Today, the crest-eater is still feared but better understood, and kasathan scientists have extensively studied the unique crystals the beasts grow. These are now the foundation for kasathan solar technology. After millennia of kasathan contact with the wider galaxy, crest-eaters have spread to other worlds, both due to kasathan technology sometimes relying on the creatures’ power-generating capabilities and as a result of other races employing crest-eaters as guard beasts, trophies to hunt, or exotic pets. The @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari} even brought crest-eaters along on its long voyage, though these are kept carefully contained; rumors of escaped and feral crest-eaters living in the ship’s ventilation shafts are assumed to be spurious.<br/><br/>A typical crest-eater is 14 feet from head to tail and is 6 feet tall at the shoulder, though this doesn’t count its elaborate protrusions. An average crest-eater weighs more than 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>warm deserts (Kasath)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or pride (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

		"Deadfall Stalker": {
			"name": "Deadfall Stalker",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Loosely resembling a spider, a deadfall stalker&rsquo;s body hosts a black hole singularity it uses to capture, crush, and digest prey. Each of these subterranean predators skitters ably on its host of legs-the number of appendages ranges from 12-31 but doesn&rsquo;t impact their creatures&rsquo; mobility and is unrelated to their age. A stalker&rsquo;s strange, spherical body has phalanxes of hairy appendages. Rather than eyes, a deadfall stalker relies on its legs&rsquo; thousands of bristles, using them to sense the faintest vibrations even through thin atmosphere or stone. Those who survive encounters with these beasts sometimes report the soft tapping of a nearby stalker as it hauntingly raps on nearby surfaces to listen for echoes and prey.</p>\n<p>As ambush hunters, deadfall stalkers quietly patrol their territory on the lookout for prey to catch unawares. They&rsquo;re adept at creeping up on targets, yet their favored tactic involves using passwall to strike from a completely unexpected direction. Once in range, a deadfall stalker scrabbles to pin down its prey with its legs before passing the immobilized meal into its jawless maw, which relies on suctioning force to crush and swallow food whole. The internal singularity and the organ that shelters it occupy roughly half the stalker&rsquo;s abdomen, and in addition to creating the gravity fields that circulate the creature&rsquo;s blood, the singularity acts as a powerful gizzard that pulverizes virtually anything the deadfall stalker swallows. The beast draws sustenance from the energy released by its prey&rsquo;s disintegrating atomic bonds and periodically excretes hyper-dense waste pellets.</p>\n<p>When a deadfall stalker accumulates too much matter, its singularity grows too powerful to remain housed safely in the creature&rsquo;s body. Within a few days, the stalker finds a safe place, hunkers down, and locks its limbs against one another in order to tear itself apart, undergoing binary fission. In addition to creating two healthy deadfall stalkers, each with half the number of legs as the original, this process snaps the singularity in half, releasing a powerful shock wave that registers on seismometers, breaks windows, and occasionally triggers cave-ins. The two halves barely acknowledge each other before skittering off to go their separate ways, gradually growing a full set of legs over the next several months.</p>\n<p>Deadfall stalkers typically live solitary existences. However, they are fairly gregarious when meeting others of their kind, often linking claws and patting each other&rsquo;s joints with remarkable tenderness before settling into a huddled tangle of limbs. They can remain this way for days on end. Because deadfall stalkers reproduce asexually, it&rsquo;s unclear why the creatures perform this soothing ritual, yet they seem to enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and purposefully seek out occasional companions. If lonely, these beasts need only seek out trails that lack dust entirely to find each other, for their singularities quietly vacuum up loose debris wherever they walk. Thankfully, this same trail helps other creatures avoid the stalkers. In at least three documented cases, however, these beasts have sought out other species for company-in each case chasing down, capturing, and then delicately grooming their distressed companion before releasing them wordlessly several hours later.</p>\n<p>The discovery of deadfall stalkers came only within the last century, when a half-orc expedition into @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.psZBx1kcx9pHsLrz]{Apostae}&rsquo;s interior unsealed a vault with walls dozens of feet thick. A torrent of deadfall stalkers fell upon the spelunkers, and the drow who received the distress calls responded by sealing off that stretch of tunnels, thinking that sufficient to stem the strange threat. However, deadfall stalkers have since infiltrated several other sections of the planet, bypassing all but the thickest barricades. Within a month, the creatures had spread beyond the drow houses&rsquo; ability to contain the threat, and deadfall stalkers have become a deadly reality for those delving the planet&rsquo;s depths.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, deadfall stalkers can barely sense their surroundings on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.psZBx1kcx9pHsLrz]{Apostae}&rsquo;s airless surface, which discourages the creatures from venturing too far into the open. Those that do become hopelessly lost, often compressing themselves into a tight mass before entering a period of hibernation. This survival technique occasionally results in stalkers hiding in surface ruins, or getting lodged into starship hulls and inadvertently hitching rides across the galaxy. These accidental stowaways adapt easily to new worlds, yet they inexplicably reproduce far slower on other planets than they do on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.psZBx1kcx9pHsLrz]{Apostae}. As much as this peculiarity baffles researches, it&rsquo;s welcome news to the distant worlds that wish to avoid being overrun.</p>\n<p>The few biologists and behaviorists who&rsquo;ve studied deadfall stalkers and lived to report their findings have discovered that the creatures don&rsquo;t espouse particularly complex belief systems, yet this information hasn&rsquo;t stopped the Cult of the Devourer from obsessing over them. Feaster sects in particular relish any opportunities to lure deadfall stalkers into populated areas, all while forming a perimeter to eliminate any bystanders who try to flee the scene. Other worshippers-especially the cult&rsquo;s recruiters-have tried to tame the deadfall stalkers to turn them into dreadful mounts or living tanks. Devourer cultists have even attempted to transport deadfall stalkers to other planets, often with disastrous results. Collectively, these destructive missions rarely go as planned, as the escaped beasts often inflict just as much havoc on their captors as they might once have on the cultists&rsquo; intended targets.</p>"

A juvenile defrex is a quadruped with splayed, clawed legs and an array of spines along its back and tail. As it ages, the defrex becomes more muscular, developing broader jaws, thicker skin, the ability to stand upright for short periods of time, and a taste for meat. Over the millennia, defrexes have inhabited the majority of Vesk-2 and have diverged from their common ancestor into numerous distinct species. These animals are among the top terrestrial predators on the planet.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">As mammals, defrexes give birth to live young, producing litters of 3 to 12 pups. The mother defends her offspring, but this instinct lasts only 5 to 7 weeks, depending on how well fed the mother is. After that, a female defrex views her offspring as competition and prey, consuming those that fail to leave the nest within a few days.

A juvenile defrex is a quadruped with splayed, clawed legs and an array of spines along its back and tail.

This shared penchant strikes well-deserved fear into the hearts of all thinking creatures in the universe, and many spacefarers know it is best to avoid ships with Dominion markings altogether.</p>\n<p>Deh-nolos are brilliant engineers and inventors among the Dominion of the Black, merging technology and biological systems in twisted and devious ways that are stunningly seamless. These creations are unlike cybernetics, in that they are often grown rather than built, and they blur the lines between living organs and complex machines. Using vulgar ingenuity and their surprisingly adroit singular &ldquo;arms,&rdquo; deh-nolos designed and built the first Dominion starships, which are hybrid vessels with both organic and technological components. They also cultivated the first shipminds-oozes that pilot these biomechanical starships. In addition to these marvels of engineering, deh-nolos are adept at repairing most technological devices, no matter what civilization built them. When presented with a device with which it is unfamiliar, a deh-nolo attempts to collect the brain of a member of the species that produced it in the hopes that doing so will provide the aberration with some flash of insight.</p>\n<p>Mostly organic beings, deh-nolos secrete a metallic discharge that shimmers with disturbing beauty in natural sunlight. Deh-nolos can concentrate this liquid to form foul crystals that they either use as ranged projectiles or work into components for their mechanical devices. Such machine parts are malformed, resembling incomplete living organs and atrophied body parts, and many have common technological connectors and partially completed circuitry. Some reckless scientists have harvested these bits from deh-nolos and plugged them into their equipment or their own bodies, with varying and unpredictable outcomes. Most of the time, the result is horrendous-and even deadly to the experimenter-but the practice occasionally creates functional, albeit macabre, technology. Installed in sensors and other devices with video or audio output, these components cause the images on their screens to appear disturbingly fragmented or amplify and distort sound into mind-shattering cacophonies. Implanted in a living creature, these parts horrendously mutate the host body and often wrack it with unceasing pain.</p>\n<p>Like many other creatures among the Dominion of the Black, deh-nolos fabricate and weaponize their own toxins. Poison-filled glands grow in patches across these creatures&rsquo; bulky bodies, and anyone who ruptures one is exposed to the purulent fluid that sloshes within. Deh-nolos can also apply this toxic pus to the projectiles that they eject from their bodies, infecting those they strike.</p>\n<p>Deh-nolos are not only extremely competent engineers, but also formidable spellcasters, weaving magic that, like their inventions, blurs the line between flesh and machine. With a thought, a deh-nolo can commandeer nearby technological devices, create a cloud of burning acid, or temporarily overwrite the DNA of a living creature to turn it into a twisted reflection of a robot. A deh-nolo uses its more offensive spells only in response to direct attacks, preferring to catch a single target unaware and render it helpless. From there, the aberration proceeds to carefully (and painfully, if the creature is still alive) extract its prey&rsquo;s brain and store it in one of its four brain pods. Deh-nolos with even one empty brain pod often go out of their way to procure a fresh replacement, almost as if they were addicted to the knowledge stored within the gray matter. A deh-nolo with no stored brains is jittery and desperate, lashing out at any non-Dominion creatures it can find, even those with animal intelligence. Once it is able to use its full complement of abilities, such a deh-nolo seeks out more sophisticated brains to replace the simpler ones, unless a more pressing matter is at hand.</p>\n<p>Deh-nolos use their psychic potential, which is inherent in most Dominion of the Black creatures, to fly with incredible dexterity. The eerie sight of their alien forms gliding silently through the air with no obvious means of propulsion is usually enough to send most sane onlookers fleeing for their lives.</p>\n<p>A typical deh-nolo stands almost 20 feet tall on its four spindly legs and weighs close to 2,000 pounds.</p>"

This fiend&rsquo;s mind is simultaneously logical and passionate, driven to promote Hell&rsquo;s order through conflict. Its restless spirit finds joy only in battle. Within Hell&rsquo;s hierarchy, levalochs serve in elite strike forces composed entirely of others of their kind or as commanders of units of other warlike devils.</p>\n<p>Fearsome in appearance and skill, warmonger devils are diabolical essences infused into constructed metallic frames. Standing 10 feet tall and weighing 1 ton, a levaloch&rsquo;s body resembles the torso of a hellish, armored knight placed atop six fiendish, clawed, insectile legs. Even compared to other devils, the anatomy of a levaloch is an enigma. They have no internal physiology at all, being little more than living suits of blasphemous chitin and Hell-forged armor. As a result, levalochs are often misidentified as constructs.</p>\n<p>A single levaloch is quite powerful on its own, but the devils&rsquo; true might lies in working alongside other devils in battle. Levalochs lead from the front lines, inspiring their allies and terrifying their foes. They are demanding, stern leaders, but they aren&rsquo;t dismissive of devils lower in Hell&rsquo;s hierarchy. Levalochs instead assess a given ally based on that being&rsquo;s capabilities and strategic utility, knowing a single powerful devil might not be able to accomplish what a horde of lesser fiends can. Warmonger devils&rsquo; grasp of strategy and tactics is undisputed, and they can understand and execute complex maneuvers. Coupled with this tactical mastery is a devious creativity that allows a levaloch to respond well to unexpected changes in a situation. This adaptability surprises foes that assume the ordered minds of devils are stagnant and resistant to change.</p>\n<p>In any confrontation, warmonger devils prefer to wipe out weaker targets first and cut off routes of escape, leaving dangerous foes without allies to call upon or any recourse but defeat or surrender. Levalochs try to avoid throwing away their own troops needlessly, not out of any sense of compassion, but out of a desire to preserve numerical advantage. Fewer troops mean a diminished ability to wage war. Regardless, levalochs value infernal warriors over mortal troops and utilize them in battle accordingly.</p>\n<p>When the forces of Hell engage in interplanetary assault, levalochs ride in the cargo cavity of a dhalochar to serve as a supplemental incursion force, quickly quelling pockets of resistance and paving the way for wider devilish invasion. Sometimes they remain within the dhalochar&rsquo;s cargo cavity until the spacefaring fiend crashes to the ground. Other times, they teleport to the planet while the dhalochar remains in the atmosphere to demolish any air defenses a defender might scramble.</p>\n<p>Levalochs can also serve as useful agents provocateurs, whether preparing a world for conquest or serving a mortal summoner. Stealthy despite their large size, they can infiltrate target locations with guile rather than numbers or direct force. A levaloch&rsquo;s true allegiance is to Hell, however, and sloppily worded contracts and orders can lead one of them to undermine mission objectives if the levaloch believes doing so is in the best interests of its infernal masters. While warmongers do not ingratiate themselves to mortals who have summoned them as easily as other devils do, they hide their motives well.</p>\n<p>Among mercenary captains in and near the Pact Worlds, stories persist of training camps run by levalochs where mortals can receive expert training at the hands of devils, paying with various services or currencies-especially souls. For the downtrodden and desperate, this deal can be tempting. More than a few amateur warriors have disappeared for a few months, only to resurface later with devilishly fierce skills in battle. Even more disturbing are the reports of a mercenary company consisting entirely of levalochs. These devils supposedly offer their services as soldiers of fortune to the highest bidder, though once again, care must be taken when drawing up the contracts for such services to avoid any conflicts of interests with the levalochs&rsquo; loyalty to Hell itself.</p>\n<p>As befits creatures designed for combat, levalochs have a particular interest in weapon technologies. Rumors swirl that several arms manufacturers use levalochs as consultants on projects, sometimes over the protestations of other employees. Corporate lawyers who craft these infernal pacts assure staff that the levalochs&rsquo; contracts are airtight. Such reassurances and the potential for increased profits are enough to assuage the fears of the corporate elite.</p>"

Arkanen home to two sapient species with a deeply intertwined history: dirindis and sazarons (see page 90). The two species co-govern their world and work on most major enterprises collaboratively. Dirindis provide creativity, optimism, and ideas, while the scholarly sazarons make sure projects stay on schedule and on budget. The two species get along well, complementing each other&rsquo;s strengths and respecting each other&rsquo;s differences.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Dirindis are stout humanoids with three eyes and an affinity for humor and electricity. They greet each other with friendly zaps of electricity and outrageous retellings of recent adventures, and visitors to Arkanen are unlikely to avoid some enthusiastic zapping from the locals.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Dirindi family units are large and complex, with extensive networks of siblings and cousins. Dirindis often adopt friends of other species into this chaos, especially sazarons, gnomes, and humans. Dirindis are born to two biological parents, but most are polyamorous, committing to multiple partners for long-term caring relationships and sharing the raising and education of the young. Although dirindis can be found in every profession, they are drawn to social professions and are often bureaucrats, educators, merchants, and politicians.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Dirindis love to laugh and believe there is no tale that cannot be made better with embellishment. Prone&nbsp;to exaggeration and hyperbole, they use allegories and jokes to approach deeper truths about the conditions and relationships of sapient beings. They&rsquo;re not out to deceive; to a dirindi, jokes aren&rsquo;t funny unless everyone gets to share in them. Dirindis treat con artists and other social predators as outcasts, and Arkanen law punishes such offenders harshly. While dirindis support ideals of honesty and disclosure, they&rsquo;re often hazy with details and don&rsquo;t mind filling knowledge gaps with conjecture. Throughout the Pact Worlds, the phrase &ldquo;as accurate as a dirindi fact-checker&rdquo; conjures their trademark lax research and unreliable newscasts. Despite this&mdash;or perhaps because of it&mdash;dirindi newscasts are among the most popular in the Pact Worlds. What they lack in strict accuracy, they make up for in raw enthusiasm. As they are gifted linguists, dirindis can broadcast in virtually every known language of the Pact Worlds.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Parallel to but separate from the dirindi population on Arkanen is that of the moon Osoro, which dirindis populated before the Gap.

Arkanen home to two sapient species with a deeply intertwined history: dirindis and sazarons (see page 90). The two species co-govern their world and work on most major enterprises collaboratively. Dirindis provide creativity, optimism, and ideas, while the scholarly sazarons make sure projects stay on schedule and on budget. The two species get along well, complementing each other&rsquo;s strengths and respecting each other&rsquo;s differences.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Dirindis are stout humanoids with three eyes and an affinity for humor and electricity.

Dirindis often adopt friends of other species into this chaos, especially sazarons, gnomes, and humans. Dirindis are born to two biological parents, but most are polyamorous, committing to multiple partners for long-term caring relationships and sharing the raising and education of the young. Although dirindis can be found in every profession, they are drawn to social professions and are often bureaucrats, educators, merchants, and politicians.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Dirindis love to laugh and believe there is no tale that cannot be made better with embellishment. Prone&nbsp;to exaggeration and hyperbole, they use allegories and jokes to approach deeper truths about the conditions and relationships of sapient beings. They&rsquo;re not out to deceive; to a dirindi, jokes aren&rsquo;t funny unless everyone gets to share in them. Dirindis treat con artists and other social predators as outcasts, and Arkanen law punishes such offenders harshly. While dirindis support ideals of honesty and disclosure, they&rsquo;re often hazy with details and don&rsquo;t mind filling knowledge gaps with conjecture. Throughout the Pact Worlds, the phrase &ldquo;as accurate as a dirindi fact-checker&rdquo; conjures their trademark lax research and unreliable newscasts. Despite this&mdash;or perhaps because of it&mdash;dirindi newscasts are among the most popular in the Pact Worlds. What they lack in strict accuracy, they make up for in raw enthusiasm. As they are gifted linguists, dirindis can broadcast in virtually every known language of the Pact Worlds.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Parallel to but separate from the dirindi population on Arkanen is that of the moon Osoro, which dirindis populated before the Gap.

As such, this loose organization houses all manner of fugitives, itinerants, and other scoundrels, and it is led by the inhabitants of Great Shadar, a waterless planet orbiting this system&rsquo;s dim star. These residents call themselves draeliks, and they are singularly united in support of the Confederacy&rsquo;s lawless ideals. To outsiders, however, they often seem more beholden to the grotesque sceaduinars: extraplanar creatures from the Negative Energy Plane, and the main figures of the most prominent draelik faith.</p>\n<p>Draeliks are gaunt humanoids who average 7 feet in height. They have vestigial gills on their necks and slightly webbed hands and feet that hint that they may have once been an aquatic race, even though their home world currently has no oceans or lakes. Instead of hair, draeliks have short bristles on their heads. The color of draeliks&rsquo; skin spans various shades of yellow, from mustard to saffron. Draeliks have three fingers and a thumb on each of their hands, and their limbs are slightly longer than those of humans.</p>\n<p>The majority of draeliks have a mystical marking resembling a third eye that usually appears on the forehead. Known as Eyes of Enlightenment, these mark them as adherents of the philosophy of Ataxxea, a belief that pays homage to sceaduinars and finds entropy to be the most sublime force in the universe. Members of this faith don&rsquo;t actively set out to destroy, but they do very little to prevent and reverse natural deterioration. They build only items that speed up this decay, mostly by using negative energy. This pseudoreligion is widespread throughout the Confederacy, and many races native to the nebula count themselves as followers, receiving the Eye of Enlightenment during a ritualistic process involving special inks distilled from dark energies. Many who get this tattoo gain powers similar to solarians who focus on the graviton aspects of their cycle.</p>\n<p>While some outsiders mistakenly conflate the nihilistic philosophy of Ataxxea with that of the Cult of the Devourer, most draeliks find the comparison deeply offensive. To them, their path is a stately and dignified march toward the inevitable and ordained end of all things, while the Devourer&rsquo;s followers cheapen the entire experience and ruin the work of generations by thrashing around in childlike tantrums, attempting to tear reality&rsquo;s fabric instead of embracing its beautiful unraveling.</p>\n<p>The few draeliks who don&rsquo;t follow these entropic beliefs generally leave the Kurzach Nebula to seek their fortunes in the wider galaxy. Despite their rejection of their home world&rsquo;s nihilism, however, they are often still drawn to careers that emphasize the deeply ingrained talents of their people, hiring themselves out as deceptive assassins, furtive thieves, or mystics of dubious morality. Draeliks encased in shining armor and fighting for the betterment of every race and creed are rare, and those who seek to shatter the mold must always contend with their inner demons, sometimes even struggling against foul temptations from sceaduinars who want to bring them back into the fold.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Native to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}, dragonkin are smaller and more humanoid than their true dragon cousins, yet more intelligent than brutish drakes and wyverns. Even before the advent of the Gap, dragonkin had a long history of alliance with humanoids, specifically in a region on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus} called the Skyfire Mandate, where many dragonkin carried ryphorian riders into battle against the armies of the evil dragons in the Drakelands. With the formation of the Pact, however, the Drakelands&rsquo; masters ramped back their cruelty to ostensibly legal levels; these dragons eschewed their expansionist wars in favor of biased laws, secret police forces, and corporate oligarchies. In the wake of this peace and the dawn of easily accessible space travel, the Skyfire Mandate&rsquo;s famed Dragon Legion was renamed the Skyfire Legion and found a new purpose as a spacefaring mercenary league that protects innocent colony worlds that are beyond the reach of the Pact&rsquo;s laws. Yet not all dragonkin and their bonded partners signed up to join the legendary militia&rsquo;s new crusade, and some instead took to the stars independently to find their own fortunes.</p>\n<p>Probably the greatest distinguishing feature of the dragonkin is their near-magical ability to bond with a non-dragonkin partner, traditionally a ryphorian. Living and working together- and often training to complement each other in combat-a dragonkin and his partner can develop such a deep bond that they begin to literally read each other&rsquo;s thoughts, allowing them to act with perfect synchronization. On @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}, this historically resulted in bonded pairs known as dragonrider pairs: a humanoid partner riding into combat on the dragonkin&rsquo;s back and providing ranged and magical support. While there are still plenty of planet-dwelling pairs who practice this ancient form of combat, today, a dragonkin and his partner more often use their link to make an exceptional starship crew or ground assault squad. The bond between dragonkin and partner goes far beyond simple combat, however. While generally not romantically involved with each other, dragonkin and their partners act in sync in nearly every aspect of their lives and form an inseparable partnership that outside relationships must accommodate.</p>\n<p>Life among the stars has led to variation within the dragonkin race, both culturally and genetically. While dragonkin adopted the use of armor, weapons, and other tools millennia ago, this reliance has accelerated dramatically in recent centuries. Dragonkin who remain on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus} and live according to tradition retain their abilities, yet those who make their homes in the cramped quarters of ships and space stations have a diminished ability to fly-a fact that drives a wedge between traditionalists and the newer breed, the latter of which claim that a good starship provides the only wings they need.</p>\n<p>Dragonkin tend to be intimidatingly stoic to strangers but loyal and fun with their friends. While the Skyfire Legion has an unusually heroic code of ethics for a mercenary unit, dragonkin in general are no more good or evil than humans, finding their own religious or moral codes or simply doing whatever it takes to protect their friends and families. While legionaries don&rsquo;t like to admit it, many dragonkin (and even their humanoid partners) are perfectly happy working for the chromatic-run corporations on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}, conducting shady operations and making sure humanoids in the Drakelands remain properly cowed. Dragonkin have a particularly complicated relationship with the vesk, as the normally aggressive reptilian race have ancient religious scriptures claiming that the spirits of the Veskarium&rsquo;s greatest warriors would be reincarnated elsewhere in a form suspiciously similar to the dragonkin, and thus vesk have always treated dragonkin with respect and deference, even when their two systems were at war.</p>\n<p>The average terrestrial dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and weighs roughly 2,000 pounds, while the spacefaring variety can be as small as half that size.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

It&rsquo;s a mystery whether a link between radiation drakes and kaiju exists that leads to their overlapping presence on some planets, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that when kaiju and radiation drakes meet, they are likely to ignore each other.

One of their first destinations within the star system was their nearest neighbor, the peach-colored gas giant known as @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}, and these pioneering barathus found the placid skies much to their liking. But something within @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}&rsquo;s composition affected the visiting barathus deeply, and the wheeling and trilling so common to the species took on a new and unique psychic significance. Over an astonishingly short span of time, at least on an evolutionary scale, these barathus underwent profound mental and physical changes. Their abilities to adapt and merge dwindled and ultimately vanished, and their intellect diminished even as their psychic prowess burgeoned. The Dreamers became psychically sensitive in ways their barathu progenitors could have never predicted.</p>\n<p>By the time the second oma-ship of barathus arrived in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}&rsquo;s skies, the first arrivals had become markedly different from the entities they once were: nearly feral, silent save for their crooning songs, seemingly oblivious to their surroundings, and yet commanding unparalleled powers of divination. Rather than renouncing their wayward kin, the barathus embraced them, calling them &ldquo;Dreamers&rdquo; due to their somnambulant behavior. Ever since, barathus have regarded their Dreamer cousins with a mix of reverence and protectiveness, an attitude that ultimately led to the barathus&rsquo; insistence upon administering @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara} as a protectorate within the Pact Worlds. This political status persists to this day, as the barathus continue to do everything in their power to protect the Dreamers.</p>\n<p>Whether the Dreamers recognize or understand their progenitors&rsquo; attitudes toward them is unknown. Left to their own among @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}&rsquo;s gentle clouds, the Dreamers wheel and dance through the skies, mewling incomprehensible songs that nevertheless carry profound psychic power. While ancient pre-Gap records indicate that the Dreamers&rsquo; songs once predicted future events with unerring accuracy, their predictions are now less precise- though no less portentous. Even those who make only a passing study of Dreamers&rsquo; songs realize that the creatures continue to prophecy some monumental event to come; the lack of detail, however, leaves open questions of the nature of the event, its timing, and whether it will be for good or ill. Some more pessimistic denizens of the Pact Worlds grumble that the Dreamers simply babble nonsense with no real clairvoyance to support their claims. These naysayers are in the minority, though-most Pact Worlders believe and wildly speculate what significant future event the Dreamers might have sensed.</p>\n<p>Dreamers pay little heed to their surroundings and other creatures. Even Dreamers within a single flotilla seem to ignore one another, though their flights through @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}&rsquo;s clouds weave complex but seemingly instinctive patterns. Those creatures that come to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara} as supplicants to the Dreamers gain no special treatment; the fact that some such petitioners eventually manifest psychic abilities may simply be a result of exposure to the same phenomenon that converted the Dreamers into what they now are. Nonetheless, this occasional happening has earned the Dreamers a reputation among some in the Pact Worlds as the bestowers of psychic sensitivity, and increasing numbers of pilgrims have visited @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara} in recent years to search for these peaceful, floating sages.</p>\n<p>A Dreamer&rsquo;s defenses are almost entirely autonomic, but when seriously injured, a Dreamer erupts into a furious rage with a debilitating psychic blast. Shortly after such an outburst, however, the Dreamer slips back into its dreamlike trance as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Even so, the creatures&rsquo; barathu protectors are likely to arrest anyone they find harassing a Dreamer and sentence them to one of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda}&rsquo;s prison moons. Barathus are eminently protective over the Dreamers, as their existence is both an artifact of both their home world and their culture.</p>\n<h2>Synesthetic Items</h2>\n<p>As Dreamers are generally protected by their barathu kin and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}&rsquo;s administrators, only a few researchers have managed to study the creatures&rsquo; peculiar synesthetic abilities, for the most part surreptitiously and with the intent to monetize their discoveries, despite Liavarans&rsquo; best attempts to discourage these practices.

			"description": "<h2>Drift Native</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The hyperspace plane of the Drift is effectively infinite, and so too is the variety of creatures it contains. While some residents are inadvertently pulled into the Drift from their native planes, many more are truly unique products of the Drift itself. Some of the better known examples include driftdead, paraforans, and the rare and powerful spectra. Whether these creatures were created by @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} or came about from the unnatural mingling of technological and planar forces is commonly debated among xenobiologists. The constant accretion of other planes and their inhabitants into the Drift makes determining any unidentified species&rsquo; origin difficult, and though time generally flows in a linear fashion in the Drift, some pockets contain planar fragments or gravitational anomalies that cause time dilation or compression. In such places, it&rsquo;s entirely possible for a species to undergo significant evolution in a relatively short time.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Of the better-known Drift natives, the time eater is simultaneously one of the most benign yet terrifying. Time eaters resemble strange neurons at a macro scale, with roughly spherical crystalline bodies bristling with translucent, flexible tentacles that stretch out far past the time eater&rsquo;s body. Typically these tentacles are entangled with those of other time eaters, forming large, weblike clusters. Due to their transparency, such webs are extremely difficult to detect as they coast through the Drift. On their own, time eaters have limited mobility. However, when they make contact with animate creatures and constructs, they can unleash devastating tentacle attacks that seem to arrest the timelines of their victims while speeding up their own. Consequently, time eaters spend a majority of their indeterminate life spans gliding through the hyperspace plane in hopes of encountering creatures from which they can steal time. As creatures native to a plane with a relatively normal passage of time, time eaters have an unusual relationship with temporality. This has lead scholars to speculate that the creatures were born from some strange interaction when pockets of the Dimension of Time were pulled into the Drift&mdash;but that realm is so poorly understood that even this explanation provides few clues.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Massive colonies of time eaters, known as &ldquo;ganglions,&rdquo; are the stuff of nightmare and legend, and starship crews swap haunting stories about moon-sized webs of time eaters descending on a planet and freezing it in time, though no such event has been recorded. Even more harrowing tales revolve around a single time eater stowing away on a ship, trapping its crew an endless, timeless moment with no hope of escape. From the few surviving records of interactions with time eaters, it seems they use the energy drained from their victims to propagate more copies of themselves, either extending their own web or sending out spores to start a new web elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">As time eaters upend the natural progression of time in pockets of the Drift, so do Drift architects manipulate the plane&rsquo;s spatial dimensions. For these amorphous, gaseous creatures, concepts of position and distance are as malleable as clay in the hands of a master sculptor. These native Drift denizens have the ability to deconstruct foreign material, such as that constantly pulled into the plane by the activation of Drift engines, and knit those realities into the fundamental essence of the plane.

			"description": "<h2>Drift Native</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The hyperspace plane of the Drift is effectively infinite, and so too is the variety of creatures it contains. While some residents are inadvertently pulled into the Drift from their native planes, many more are truly unique products of the Drift itself. Some of the better known examples include driftdead, paraforans, and the rare and powerful spectra. Whether these creatures were created by @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} or came about from the unnatural mingling of technological and planar forces is commonly debated among xenobiologists. The constant accretion of other planes and their inhabitants into the Drift makes determining any unidentified species&rsquo; origin difficult, and though time generally flows in a linear fashion in the Drift, some pockets contain planar fragments or gravitational anomalies that cause time dilation or compression. In such places, it&rsquo;s entirely possible for a species to undergo significant evolution in a relatively short time.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Of the better-known Drift natives, the time eater is simultaneously one of the most benign yet terrifying. Time eaters resemble strange neurons at a macro scale, with roughly spherical crystalline bodies bristling with translucent, flexible tentacles that stretch out far past the time eater&rsquo;s body. Typically these tentacles are entangled with those of other time eaters, forming large, weblike clusters. Due to their transparency, such webs are extremely difficult to detect as they coast through the Drift. On their own, time eaters have limited mobility. However, when they make contact with animate creatures and constructs, they can unleash devastating tentacle attacks that seem to arrest the timelines of their victims while speeding up their own. Consequently, time eaters spend a majority of their indeterminate life spans gliding through the hyperspace plane in hopes of encountering creatures from which they can steal time. As creatures native to a plane with a relatively normal passage of time, time eaters have an unusual relationship with temporality. This has lead scholars to speculate that the creatures were born from some strange interaction when pockets of the Dimension of Time were pulled into the Drift&mdash;but that realm is so poorly understood that even this explanation provides few clues.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Massive colonies of time eaters, known as &ldquo;ganglions,&rdquo; are the stuff of nightmare and legend, and starship crews swap haunting stories about moon-sized webs of time eaters descending on a planet and freezing it in time, though no such event has been recorded. Even more harrowing tales revolve around a single time eater stowing away on a ship, trapping its crew an endless, timeless moment with no hope of escape. From the few surviving records of interactions with time eaters, it seems they use the energy drained from their victims to propagate more copies of themselves, either extending their own web or sending out spores to start a new web elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">As time eaters upend the natural progression of time in pockets of the Drift, so do Drift architects manipulate the plane&rsquo;s spatial dimensions. For these amorphous, gaseous creatures, concepts of position and distance are as malleable as clay in the hands of a master sculptor. These native Drift denizens have the ability to deconstruct foreign material, such as that constantly pulled into the plane by the activation of Drift engines, and knit those realities into the fundamental essence of the plane.

Their powerful unguligrade legs end in long, hooved toes, while their shorter forelimbs include strong dewclaws and fingers that allow the manipulation of tools. Long necks end in drooped heads, atop which stubby eyestalks allow their eyes to move independently, giving dromadas a wide field of vision.

The skittish creatures reacted to danger first by emitting a deep moan that would alert the entire herd, then bolt for safety in huge stampedes. As they gradually learned to use tools, communicate with spoken language, and develop more advanced technology, dromadas retained these behaviors, which continue to serve them well even as they join the galactic community. While dromadas are a sapient species and as such are not considered food to most other sapient species, there are a few evil species willing to go to great lengths to obtain dromada meat, which is reported to have a unique and savory flavor.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Dromadas usually operate in large family units and rarely do anything individually. The herbivorous creatures prefer open spaces large enough for an entire group and with good visibility, especially when eating. Half the group eats while the other half keeps watch, with the groups switching roles so everyone gets to graze. Dromada homes are usually large, single-story buildings with plenty of exits that can accommodate an entire herd. The floors of such structures are often used to grow the grasses they feed on so that the dromadas can spend their free time grouped together grazing in the safety of their homes. Dromada herds can be large enough to staff entire corporations, where employees live and work together in large compounds with open floor plans. Such enterprises can be found in a staggering array of industries, providing products and services that range from plant‑based meat substitutes to social media consultancy.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">In their youth, dromadas train in specific skill sets so they can provide a variety of services to the herd as adults. Members of dromada society place great importance on their responsibilities; the more the herd can provide for itself, the less it needs to depend upon potentially dangerous outsiders. When dromadas become curious about the outside world, they travel short distances from the herd in small groups called huddles. When confronted with anything they perceive as dangerous, members of the huddle flee to the safety of the herd and warn others about what they encountered. Smaller groups of dromadas living permanently in densely populated, cosmopolitan urban areas continue this trend, and frequently rely heavily on delivery services, ensuring no one has to leave the herd to obtain supplies.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Dromadas do not consider leadership of a dromada herd to be an honor or something to aspire to, as leaders become targets simply by virtue of their position. Most dromada herds elect their leaders democratically and for limited terms, but because an average dromada has no interest in taking on a leadership role, the herd itself nominates candidates for political office&mdash;whether an individual wants to run or not.

Dromadas can nonetheless find themselves alone, whether because they were exiled, they were the sole survivors of an attack, or they were left behind due to sickness or injury. Such dromadas instinctively look for a surrogate herd to join as soon as possible. A dromada&rsquo;s trust is very difficult to earn, as they view everything around them as potentially dangerous and can be extremely skittish, but they are loyal and constant companions to those who eventually gain their friendship.

Their soldiers specialize in the use of ranged weapons, favoring teamwork tactics to undermine their foes&rsquo; defenses&mdash;though even an otherwise loyal sniper wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to prioritize his personal vendetta and take advantage of a clear line of fire to a rival in the chaos of a firefight.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Some drow are born with gifts beyond those of most of their kind, including greater magical power. These individuals are referred to as drow nobles, and are most commonly born to other drow nobles within the powerful ruling houses through the aid of genetic-selection technology that is tightly controlled by those houses. However, it is not unheard of for a drow noble to be born to common parents without any genetic intervention. Such gifted progeny, upon realizing their talents, typically leverage them to gain a higher position in society, whether by aligning themselves with one of the powerful houses or striking out to earn a name for themselves. Given their exceptional talents, drow nobles quickly rise through the ranks and are soon recognized for their achievements even if a few common drow happen to disappear along their path to power.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">A drow noble scion of a powerful arms-dealing house might lead a branch of the family arms dealership, traveling throughout the Pact Worlds and fledgling colonies to secure buyers for the advanced technology her house produces based on the relics plumbed from their world. Other scions reinforce their noble houses&rsquo; connections with their demon lord patrons, becoming powerful mystics, or train as technomancers with a goal of unraveling the mysteries of the portal-gate at the center of Nightarch (see pages 458&ndash;459 of the&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>).</span></p>"

			"name": "Ellicoth",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Standing 50 feet tall and weighing upward of 30 tons, an ellicoth resembles a strange two-trunked elephant perched on incongruously narrow, stilt-like legs. Its stocky body is covered with horns and growths, and its skin is heavily blistered and cracked from the radiation it absorbs and stores within itself, making it appear perpetually raw and burned. While some of this radiation comes from the cosmic rays that bombard @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}&rsquo;s surface due to its lack of a protective atmosphere, even more of it is absorbed from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}&rsquo;s wastelands, as the creatures seem mysteriously drawn to those regions still heavily radioactive from the cataclysm that ravaged @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox} ages ago.</p>\n<p>Records from the bone sages report that ellicoths predate the nuclear disaster that befell @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, indicating that at one point ellicoths were gentle herbivores whose long legs and lithe trunks allowed them to safely reach the luscious fruits atop tall spike-trunked jicobalan trees. During the disaster, however, several herds were caught in the backlash of magical energy, causing them to mutate. Today, the mournful ellicoths no longer eat vegetation or even breathe like normal animals. Instead, they siphon vital energy directly from other creatures and use it to sustain their own agonized existences. Ellicoths can survive just as easily on the necromantic energies that animate undead as on the soul energy of living creatures, and most of their diet consists of ghosts, zombies, and other spontaneously generated undead in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}&rsquo;s wastelands. Occasionally, however, a stampede of desperate or enraged ellicoths will crash through the protective walls around Eoxian settlements and gorge in a feeding frenzy until the local military can mobilize to bring them down. While the bone sages are thus careful to keep local ellicoth populations in check, driving the most aggressive populations out into the distant wastes, most see the advantage of keeping a few around to remind citizens that even the undead need the protection of a strong government.</p>\n<p>Not all bone sages are content to let ellicoths remain wild, however. Continuing a tradition that stretches back even before the Gap, several bone sages still employ fearsome ellicoth cavalries in their militias. From armored howdahs built onto and around the horns atop the creatures&rsquo; broad backs, undead soldiers immune to ellicoths&rsquo; aura of radiation rain destruction down on their opponents, guiding the beasts through magic or direct neurotech linkages. Despite the expense of keeping the creatures and the advantages presented by more conventional vehicles, ellicoths&rsquo; ability to completely devour an opponent&rsquo;s life force doubles as a useful psychological weapon, and their spindly legs can support a surprising amount of weight, allowing for thick armor plates to be affixed to their hide or heavy weapons to be mounted on their horns.</p>\n<p>Ellicoths are mammalian and give birth to live young one at a time, which mature to full size within a few years and can live for centuries. Rather than having a designated leader, each herd tends to follow whichever adult member is moving with the most purpose at any given time, leading to chaotic and unpredictable movements when threatened. Ellicoth corpses are extremely rare; when an ellicoth grows old and its internal organs begin to fail, it instinctively leaves the herd and heads for the most powerful source of radiation in the area-usually the center of a radioactive waste-and proceeds to lie down and sing its dirges loudly and continually until its body finally gives out. Once it does, unknown processes within its cells, possibly related to the storage of radiation, cause the corpse to suddenly and dramatically break down, transforming the creature into a puddle of radioactive ooze within hours.</p>\n<p>While their docile wandering punctuated by occasional feeding frenzies leads people to dismiss ellicoths as brutes, they&rsquo;re significantly smarter than most give them credit for. Although unable to speak, they still manage to understand rudimentary language when exposed to it regularly, and those few naturalists or trainers who&rsquo;ve interacted extensively with them believe them to have significantly more complicated inner lives than ordinary animals. Attempts to decipher their haunting bellows, which rumble through the ground and the planet&rsquo;s poisoned remnants of an atmosphere, have so far failed to reveal any natural language among the creatures, but ellicoths instructed in Eoxian and presented with words and pictograms to point at with their trunks have revealed a startling discovery. Though lacking the consciousness necessary for even an oral history, ellicoths maintain a racial memory of the planet&rsquo;s destruction and the time before it, describing a deep-seated sadness at the way things are and a longing for a time of green fields and tall trees-a time no living ellicoth has ever known. How exactly this memory has been passed down remains a mystery, and the ellicoths themselves have no sense of what it means, other than to repeatedly point to the word &ldquo;waiting.&rdquo;</p>"

They are omnivorous, eating fish, smaller aquatic animals, and fruit in equal quantity. While elmeshras might seem lethargic, floating calmly with their eyes just above the surface, they are surprisingly quick to act, especially if provoked or when a tempting bit of prey swims too close. Elmeshras tend to eat close to their weight in food every day. They spawn in shallow pools and marshes during @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}&rsquo;s summer, and the handful that survive to reach the winter hibernate through it, storing fertilized eggs to release as the weather improves. A typical elmeshra is over 12 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Before the Gap, it was common for dragons and rhyphorians to dig up the massive amphibians throughout the winter. Their carcasses provided meat for lean winter days, but also elmeshra oil-originally drained from the creature&rsquo;s flesh and extracted chemically-which protected against fatal freezing. Triaxians no longer rely on elmeshras for survival, but elmeshra steaks are still considered a delicacy by certain long-lived dragons, and the oil is often used as an ingredient in high-end perfumes.</p>\n<p>On @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}, hibernating elmeshras can occasionally be found buried in ice floes, but it&rsquo;s more common to find living versions on other planets. The ease of shipping frozen elmeshras makes them a common animal attraction in zoos and a popular quarry in hunting expeditions across many systems. However, outside of their natural environment, elmeshras engage in frequent cycles of spawning that can rapidly cause ecological blight.</p>\n<p>Elmeshra eggs are found clustered in spheres up to 10 feet in diameter and hatch based on the weather. When they finally spring forth, hundreds of elmeshra spawn surge across land and sea alike. These spawn sometimes overwhelm larger animals, especially those still adjusting to the changing season.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

			"description": "<h2>Embri</h2>\n<p>The embri are highly evolved mollusks with an exceptionally rigid social order. Every embri knows its place among the hierarchy of embri society and performs the duties of its station without complaint. The society&rsquo;s few rebels or free thinkers, when discovered, are exiled or executed. This rigid order has allowed embri society to excel in technological and magical development, although outsiders view embri creations as soulless or downright gruesome&mdash; their vast, fiery factory-forges ring with the rhythmic clang of machinery, and blood-fueled vermicular vessels heave across their world with peristaltic contractions.</p>\n<p>Embri evolved from aquatic ancestors long ago, and their four strong limbs have sharp claws at the end allowing them to walk upright on land. These claws have significant flexibility, so embri can use tools and weapons. The average embri is 4 feet tall with a trailing tail that&rsquo;s slightly longer, and most weigh around 200 pounds. Embri reproduce asexually, and while they once would bud young based on the seasons of their home world, budding is now rigidly controlled by embri bureaucracy and allowed only on schedules set by the office of the spawning administrator. Young embri are raised in institutional academies where they&rsquo;re trained to be diligent and compliant and are rewarded for informing on classmates who demonstrate deviant thinking or &ldquo;anomalous independence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Embri have a highly developed brain-sac at the top of their heads, and their faces consist of two small, closely set eyes above a slit that functions as a combination of nose and ears&mdash; they exhale from this orifice to produce a whistling speech. Embri mouths are used solely for eating and are tucked away on the underside of their bodies. Embri consider eating a private, embarrassing function, and they are repulsed at how openly and communally other races eat.</p>\n<p>Culturally, embri long ago mastered social conditioning to eliminate all displays of emotion; they consider expressiveness to be barbaric, and the occasional embri who shows feelings openly is considered primitive and dangerous. As a side effect of keeping their own feelings in check, embri easily pick up on signs of emotions. To prevent inadvertent displays of emotion, embri wear ornate masks. These masks also denote social standing, civic responsibilities, and other designators that allow embri to immediately assess one another by sight. Embri wear their masks at all times, even when sleeping, and to be without a mask is a profound embarrassment&mdash;it evidences a gross exposure of an embri&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings, rendering it unable to effectively protect its own emotions and too distracted to effectively read the expressions of others.</p>\n<p>Few embri realize their rigid social hierarchy is controlled by the forces of Hell&mdash;scheming devils direct all embri activities from the secret tunnels beneath the mollusks&rsquo; home world. These dictates are conveyed by the small group of embri, known as Speakers, who communicate with the devils directly and enact their infernal designs. In exchange for this service, Speakers are granted magical powers and the secrets of diabolical manipulation. Some Speakers also serve as diplomats and envoys from the embri to the Pact Worlds. In these roles, they both shield their people from dangerously individualistic thinking and extend their masters&rsquo; designs to the rest of the galaxy. Speakers usually travel with a coterie of devoted embri servants who, in their uniquely expressionless way, idolize the Speaker as a celebrity.</p>\n<p>The diabolic taint on embri society is pervasive, yet subtle. For example, the embri language now contains several Infernal words and phrases, and though embri shun symbols of deific obedience as an overemotional expression of connection to the divine, stylized iconography of infernal origin features prominently in modern embri architecture.</p>\n<h2>Hivemasks</h2>\n<p>Many embri work hard to afford masks with magical abilities. In addition to the ordinary functions of displaying social status and shielding an embri&rsquo;s emotions, these masks provide additional abilities to embri wearing them. One of the most common of these masks is the @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.cc8WEM3uAzteBI2W]{Hivemask}.</p>"

However, a vesk mining company that was scouting that system detected starmetal veins beneath the planet&rsquo;s crust. In the feverish mining race that followed, factions from across the galaxy fought to gain a foothold on what came to be known as Calen 5. Invading miners razed vast swaths of forest, and koruvis, among the other native species of Calen 5, soon went extinct as their home was destroyed. In one of the early settlements on Calen 5, Hope&rsquo;s Edge, residents reported mysterious property damage, such as holes ripped into buildings and electrical equipment badly mangled, and rumors spread of a pack of ghostly monsters skulking around town. Today, Hope&rsquo;s Edge has grown into the de facto capital of Calen 5, but koruvi endlings still fiercely attack the city in a never-ending pursuit of revenge against the cause of their extinction.</span></p>"

Eohis give birth to live young, which are nursed by their mothers until their fangs grow in, usually in about 3 months.

Eventually, the kish (see page 58) in that city saw how useful eohis could be in a hunt and tamed some of them, training them to take down larger prey and to guard kish homes and livestock from the city&rsquo;s other predators.</p>\n<p>An eohi stands about 2 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs almost 70 pounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

A small, frigid planetoid at the farthest reaches of its star system, Neeroon is a rugged world with a variety of biomes, from taigas to rocky badlands, and sky-scraping mountains to ice-filled canyons. The coloration of espraksas varies depending on the environment in which their ancestors evolved. Espraksas who adapted to the taigas of Neeroon developed deep-brown or russet feathers, while those who live in the snowy peaks have white or gray feathers lightly speckled with black or a mossy green. Espraksas have a thick collar of feathers to keep their long, slender necks warm. They also have lengthy antennae-like feathers that extend from the inner corners of their eyes. Males have crests of feathers that extend from the crowns of their heads and are expressive enough to communicate emotion. Espraksas stand about 7 feet tall and weigh 175 pounds.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Espraksas consider themselves the offspring of the deities @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Weydan}, unified in a pairing called the Wings.

They often embark on a journey of self-discovery in an unofficial coming-of-age ceremony, traveling the galaxy and immersing themselves in other cultures. Espraksas love to make friends, even with the surliest of folk, establishing positive emotional connections that are passionate and enduring.

			"description": "<h2>Espraksa</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The avian espraksas originated from the Near Space planet of Neeroon. A small, frigid planetoid at the farthest reaches of its star system, Neeroon is a rugged world with a variety of biomes, from taigas to rocky badlands, and sky-scraping mountains to ice-filled canyons. The coloration of espraksas varies depending on the environment in which their ancestors evolved. Espraksas who adapted to the taigas of Neeroon developed deep-brown or russet feathers, while those who live in the snowy peaks have white or gray feathers lightly speckled with black or a mossy green. Espraksas have a thick collar of feathers to keep their long, slender necks warm. They also have lengthy antennae-like feathers that extend from the inner corners of their eyes. Males have crests of feathers that extend from the crowns of their heads and are expressive enough to communicate emotion. Espraksas stand about 7 feet tall and weigh 175 pounds.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Espraksas consider themselves the offspring of the deities @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Weydan}, unified in a pairing called the Wings. Their open, sociable, and free-spirited society reffects this origin story. Though the rule of law is important to espraksas, the application of wisdom and compassion is equally so. Espraksa settlements often have shrines dedicated to the Wings.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Espraksa settlements also emphasize harmony with nature. They avoid razing the environment to make way for their settlements, instead incorporating their towns and homes high up in the surrounding trees and terrain. This architecture has left few means for land-bound creatures to enter from the ground. As tourism to Neeroon has grown more common, the espraksas have had to accommodate flightless creatures.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Wanderlust and gregariousness are intrinsic to espraksa society on Neeroon despite individual regions having many quirks, which it seems their peoples took pains to preserve. Espraksas revel in exploration, whether literal, interpersonal, or spiritual. They often embark on a journey of self-discovery in an unofficial coming-of-age ceremony, traveling the galaxy and immersing themselves in other cultures. Espraksas love to make friends, even with the surliest of folk, establishing positive emotional connections that are passionate and enduring. Most espraksas can proudly recollect every friend made on their journeys and find enemies only under extreme circumstances.

Their corrupted minds twist this yearning for companionship into terrible attacks on living creatures. Exsiccates search for those with warm bodies and beating hearts to latch onto and tear off strips of their flesh. Unlike ghouls, exsiccates don&rsquo;t eat this flesh, instead layering it across their bodies as if trying to create a second skin. This stolen skin doesn&rsquo;t last for long, drying similarly to the exsiccate&rsquo;s original flesh, and usually flakes away within a matter of hours.

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>This ambulatory fungus resembles a very thick lichen, with shoots of long, coiled, fernlike tendrils at the center of its mass. Shorter stalks end in hand-sized pods, which dispense clouds of fine spores. While the feeder fungus has limited mobility, it is nonetheless an effective ambush predator. The spores it releases have a narcotic effect on most creatures, and once a victim is affected, the fungus extends tendrils to grab and throttle its prey. The corpses of its prey provide the fungus with food as well as their means of propagation: once a feeder fungus has accumulated more than it needs to subsist, it produces a special pod it implants in a hollowed-out corpse, which develops into a new feeder fungus. Feeder fungi are repelled by the spores of other feeder fungi, a biological mechanism that encourages a younger fungus to disperse. Newly spawned fungi are smaller than mature specimens and have shorter tendrils, which they use for more rapid movement; such fungi are usually CR 2 and Small with a 30-foot speed and a 5-foot reach. These mobility tendrils grow into grasping tendrils after the fungus has made its first kill, using its prey to fuel its growth into adult size.</p>\n<p>The feeder fungus&rsquo;s narcotic spores can be used to synthesize medical-grade tier 2 sedatives. A character can harvest a single spore pod from a helpless or dead feeder fungus with a successful DC 22 Medicine or DC 27 Survival check. This pod is worth 3,000 credits and contains enough material (treat as virtual UPBs that can be used only to craft sedatives) to create 5 doses of sedative.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

A queen&rsquo;s physical existence is rooted in reproduction: her first responsibility is laying the eggs that populate the hive. Indeed, she can&rsquo;t actually stop this process, which takes place largely without conscious thought as she goes about her business. In emergencies, some queens resort to extreme hormonal treatments to suppress their laying, but such drastic means are rarely employed. Once they start laying, most queens never physically move more than a few feet at a time; in the rare event that they must be relocated, they are carried upon massive palanquins by members of the hive or are installed on hovering thrones.</p>\n<p>These physical constraints don&rsquo;t mean a queen is helpless or powerless. A queen has defensive capabilities unparalleled in the hive, including the ability to teleport herself away from danger if overwhelmed. She can turn her telepathic prowess into a weapon to harm and disable foes, and she can possess any member of the hive to borrow their senses and inspect locations, interact with others, or confront intruders &ldquo;in person.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Each formian hive-typically an entire settlement-has its own queen, and the hive is absolutely subordinate to the queen, epitomizing the ultimate order and hierarchical nature of formian society. In the distant past, this loyalty led to tremendous conflict between hives, as each queen and hive pursued its own agenda and perceived the others as threats. The long-ago establishment of the abstract concept of the &ldquo;Overqueen&rdquo; among the formian queens of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} enabled separate hives to unify their goals and operations, effectively creating one metahive among all of formian society on that planet. The directives established by the Overqueen are purposefully broad suggestions promoting the well-being of the formian race, so as to avoid infighting between queens trying to set more specific goals.</p>\n<p>Within a hive, the queen is the absolute authority: she establishes the overall direction and goals for the hive, which the various hive members-from the powerful myrmarchs down to the countless workers-strive to carry out. Part of this comes from the fact that the vast majority of a hive&rsquo;s members are direct offspring of the queen (in fact, when a new queen takes over, a hive sees massive turnover as its members are rapidly replaced with the new queen&rsquo;s brood); as with most social insects, the genetic similarity of a single queen&rsquo;s offspring leads to tight social bonds and minimal competition.

The creature is covered in white or gray fur and has two beady eyes spaced far apart on its face; its most striking feature is a set of fiery tusks, glowing with heat.

		"Glass Serpent": {
			"name": "Glass Serpent",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The terrifying ambush predators known as glass serpents are some of the most notorious beasts to roam the blasted wastelands of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, preying on local fauna and unwary undead alike. Similar creatures have been found on dozens of planets, including those outside the Pact Worlds, leading scholars to speculate that glass serpents may have been brought to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox} in its ancient past through magical means, or that they may represent a natural case of parallel evolution on worlds that have suffered massive catastrophes.</p>\n<p>Glass serpents have long, undulating bodies that bulge and narrow at regular intervals, giving them a shape almost like a chain of thick links. Their heads are much different from those of traditional snakes, with a row of eyes peering out from beneath an armored, helmetlike crest, and long feeding tentacles each tipped with a glowing, crystalline tooth dangling from their mouths. Yet, the most fearsome aspect of glass serpents must be their legendary scales: smooth crystalline structures that warp and wrap light around the serpents, turning them invisible and making them terrifying combatants. This invisibility isn&rsquo;t entirely voluntary and requires enough energy from a serpent that it can activate the ability only when it is hungry and hunting. When well fed, the serpent becomes visible once more, its body appearing partially translucent and strewn with shimmering rainbows. This weakness is of no comfort to those creatures that become the serpent&rsquo;s prey and provide it with sustenance, pieces of which are visible as they pass through the serpent&rsquo;s translucent digestive system. An adult glass serpent can grow to be 60 feet long and up to 5,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Hermaphroditic and capable of mating as long as they&rsquo;re sufficiently nourished, glass serpents have a fascinating courtship process. A glass serpent looking to mate seeks out another glass serpent of roughly its own size and ability level and challenges it in an elaborate ritual. Once this challenge is accepted, the two become a &ldquo;rival pair.&rdquo; For the next 6 weeks, the two travel together, hunting in tandem but violently attempting to keep the other from eating a share of any slain prey. At the end of this period, they seek out the largest and most powerful glass serpent they can find and attempt to woo this third serpent into accepting the mantle of motherhood via displays of their prowess and gifts of regurgitated food. If this third serpent agrees, it and the larger, better-fed member of the rival pair-called the &ldquo;bull&rdquo;-mate. The bull then departs, and the other member of the rival pair-the &ldquo;guard&rdquo;-remains to serve the pregnant serpent, bringing food and providing defense until the young are born. Young glass serpents are capable of hunting on their own within a month, at which point all members of the family go their separate ways.</p>\n<p>Not intelligent enough to be considered truly sentient, glass serpents are nevertheless cunning hunters and opportunists, with natural curiosity and adaptability in addition to their predatory instincts. Although glass serpents can diminish the glow in their tentacles&rsquo; crystalline teeth to better preserve their invisibility, they understand that the light itself remains visible even when their bodies are not. As such, many will purposefully illuminate these lures while invisible, creating delicate, dancing displays of light or even mimicking signal beacons, hoping to draw prey near. Glass serpents have learned that creatures from other worlds often require air, and they specifically target such creatures, ripping open environment suits, vehicles, or structures to asphyxiate their prey.</p>\n<p>For all the danger they present, glass serpents have long been a part of Eoxian culture, taking on the cultural role of noble predator that other groups often ascribe to wolves, lions, eagles, or dragons. Domesticated glass serpents are the chosen hunting beasts of both the planet&rsquo;s nobility and its criminal organizations. Several Bone Sages and ancient organizations have glass serpents on their coats of arms or corporate logos, and execution by glass serpent is an ancient practice that still continues. In recent centuries, the creatures have been heavily exported to other planets, partially for their status in Eoxian culture but more often because their scales can be commercially harvested for illusion magic and a wide variety of optical technologies. The challenge of imprisoning smart animals that can turn invisible and don&rsquo;t need to breathe means that wild glass serpent populations can now be found on nearly every terrestrial or aquatic planet in the Pact Worlds and many colony worlds beyond. Most notably, the @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{Diaspora} has seen significant problems with glass serpents adapting to the highly trafficked waterways of the River Between, where despite their slight disadvantage in movement and stealth, they still prove devastating to travelers. Many cr&egrave;che worlds regularly hire mercenaries and adventurers to hunt down and eradicate these serpents, but the population keeps mysteriously bouncing back.</p>\n<h2>Glass Scale Technology</h2>\n<p>Glass serpent scales are a wonder of evolution, capturing and bending light with their unique molecular structure. Simply skinning a dead glass snake results in a pretty but useless hide, as the motion of the scales and their relationship to the muscle underneath are both key to their function. When properly harvested and arranged, the scales can effectively augment armor or even other creatures&rsquo; skins, granting the wearers a measure of the serpents&rsquo; invisibility. Originally developed by Eoxian technomancers, this glasstech was quickly replicated by the drow arms dealers of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.psZBx1kcx9pHsLrz]{Apostae}, and from there it spread throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

		"Golem, Neutronium": {
			"name": "Golem, Neutronium",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Neutronium, the material found in the heart of a neutron star, is one of the densest substances in existence. Just a spoonful of it would weigh billions of tons and, if dropped onto the surface of a planet, would simply puncture the planet&rsquo;s crust until it reached the core. Further, neutronium possesses some unusual properties; because it has no electrons, it does not interact with light. Scientists have studied neutronium for centuries, with many of them pursuing the practical goal of weaponizing the substance.</p>\n<p>Recently, a group of drow mystics and technomancers made a breakthrough while working to decode ancient texts supposedly written by @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.kN8pC8Yfi8OuCvig]{Eloritu}. After decades of work, they managed to temporarily bind an elemental spirit to a neutron star. The elemental, working from within the star, was able to remove a tiny piece of super-dense neutronium, which the drow then isolated with force magic. The team experimented on this rare sample for months on end, until they finally perfected a technomagical process that reduced the density of the neutronium enough to make it more workable, while simultaneously shaping the now enormous object into a vaguely humanoid form. They moved the bound elemental spirit out of its star and into this new vessel, and the first neutronium golem was created.</p>\n<p>Since then, the method of crafting neutronium golems has spread through the Pact Worlds. The drow creators of the technique have even begun to industrialize the process, producing neutronium golems in the dozens and charging exorbitant sums for them. Unfortunately, their work has angered some of the drow&rsquo;s demon lord patrons, which has led some elements of Apostae&rsquo;s ruling class to call for their expulsion from drow society, if not outright execution. House Brevak in particular has spent a great deal of resources to eliminate these &ldquo;rogue elements&rdquo; from drow society and take over the production of neutronium golems-for the good of all drow, naturally.</p>\n<p>A neutronium golem is invisible in light but pitch black in darkness; this quality makes it both a deadly assassin and a useful guardian. Species with natural darkvision- like drow-can easily see and interact with these golems in the darkness that is their natural environment. But when intruders trespass into the lightless chambers where a golem is stationed, any illumination they bring with them only serves to make the neutronium golem more dangerous. In addition, the incredible density and neutral charge of neutronium grants the construct a number of immunities even beyond those normally associated with a golem. However, a neutronium golem does have weaknesses. By delivering a charge to the neutronium that makes up the golem&rsquo;s body, its immunity to light is temporarily negated, causing it to become visible. The magical forces which give the neutronium a humanoid form are also precariously balanced, so rapid fluctuations in gravity can disrupt the golem&rsquo;s body.

Properly binding this spirit, which is usually from an earth elemental, is the most important part of creating a golem. As the spirit is only semiconscious, the golem exists in a mindless state and acts only to defend itself or to follow orders from its creator. In some golems, injury causes the elemental spirit to stir in its artificial shell. As it gains awareness, it rages at its imprisonment.</span></p>"

			"name": "Gray",
			"description": "<p>No one knows what planet or even galaxy the grays call home, but reports of their unnerving abductions, nightmarish paralysis, and mysterious experiments have been collected from countless worlds for as long as starships have sailed in the dark spaces of the universe. Such reports are fragmentary and unreliable, offered by victims recounting hazy memories of enduring various procedures under clinically bright lights or waking in cramped and lightless confinement, and do little to explain the methodology or goals of their captors. Those captors, though, have much in common no matter the specific circumstances or the species of the victim: an otherworldly presence, condescending interactions, and a sinister disregard for the agency and dignity of those they take as subjects for their experiments.</p>\n<p>Grays communicate only telepathically, even among their own kind. Their faces and glassy black eyes show little emotion or reaction, and while graceful, they usually move with deliberate intention, often spending several moments in thought before committing to an action or movement. This inscrutability renders them enigmatic and disturbing to most other races.</p>\n<p>Little is known about the grays&rsquo; motivations, and to date no efforts have been successful at establishing diplomatic relationships with them. However, their goals appear to center around the search for information, rather than conquest. Victims of their paralytic abductions are almost always returned mostly unharmed, though the sudden appearance of a series of scars or an inexplicable implant undermines the effects of the grays&rsquo; ability to erase memories of the experience. Researchers wonder at the end goals of this accumulation of knowledge and what purposes the information gleaned may serve in the meantime. Some fringe scientists believe grays are preparing for an eventual all-out invasion, while others posit they are simply curious about us, but their alien mindsets lead them to sate this inquisitiveness in disturbing ways.</p>\n<p>Once rare enough that reports of their abductions were written off as conspiracy and delusion, encounters with grays have become disturbingly more common with the advent of Drift travel. Their sleek, disk-shaped starships lurk in the dark corners of the Drift, appearing seemingly out of nowhere to confront vessels with inattentive or unwary crews. Much like the grays themselves, their ships are designed less for offense and more for evading and subduing their targets, employing tractor beams and EMP weapons to disable and control a vessel, preserving its crew as test subjects. Such captives find themselves unable to move, held under brilliant lights, their captors mere silhouettes as their thoughts and memories are sifted under the gray&rsquo;s psychic touch.</p>\n<h2>Memory Expunger</h2>\n<p>The mind is still a thing of mystery. Neuroscientists have yet to isolate the exact nature of consciousness, and while they can tell which portions of the brain are responsible for storing memories, purely technological methods of creating or implanting memories have failed on every level. However, deleting memories seems to be a much simpler task, and certain amoral research firms have studied enough of grays&rsquo; abilities to create the following piece of illegal tech.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Memory Expunger</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Level 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Technological Item</td>\n<td>Price: 50,000</td>\n<td>Bulk: L</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This metal-and-glass disk is 4 inches in diameter and has a small red button along its perimeter. By presenting the disk to a creature within 10 feet and pressing the button (all a standard action), you can erase the last 5 minutes of that creature&rsquo;s memory as per modify memory by introducing a series of flashing lights into its visual sensors that directly affects the brain. The creature can attempt a DC 20 Will saving throw to negate this effect. A creature currently being threatened by you or your allies receives a +4 circumstance bonus to the save. A creature that succeeds at the save is instead dazzled for 1d4+4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting sense-dependent effect.</p>\n<p>A memory expunger uses a standard battery, and each use expends 5 charges.</p>"

Scientists who study grays theorize that gray bounders are native to the gray home world. The species are similar and share genetic material. While specific bounders might show signs of augmentation or bioengineering, some evidence suggests that bounders were naturally domesticated by grays for their own nefarious purposes.</p>\n<p>Gray bounders are more cunning than dogs, though, and far more malevolent. Unlike their gray masters, gray bounders are muscular, fast, and agile. They move with little of the deliberation a gray normally employs. Instead, gray bounders are jittery and in near-constant motion, as though endlessly looking for a position from which to leap on potential prey. When they stalk or strike prey, gray bounders can be cruel, toying with targets for as long as possible before finishing them off.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

		"Gray Goo": {
			"name": "Gray Goo",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Over millennia, explorers from across the known galaxy pass down fearful tales of a sentient, liquid-like swarm of nanites that can envelop creatures and quickly turn them to dust. Once connected to grays, a mysterious species of abductors who used advanced fringe technology with a similar silvery sheen, these creatures gained the moniker gray goo. However, the term has survived despite there being no corroborating evidence that firmly links</p>\n<p>the two.</p>\n<p>The only solid information about gray goo originates from the scattered reports of rare surviving witnesses. Gray goo attacks its victims by surprise, taking advantage of any hapless beings it comes across as it roams a desolate wasteland. Indeed, another commonality among gray goo sightings is the entity&rsquo;s seeming preference for places devoid of life&mdash;though many argue that the gray goos created such environments. Scientists posit that most gray goo originates with a sapient species&rsquo; often wellintentioned attempt to develop an autonomous nanite swarm that can affect technological repairs, perform delicate biomedical operations, or even terraform. However, even a simple error in their programming, or in some cases the malicious introduction of a deadly code hack, can have disastrous effects, especially for swarms that can ingest a wide range of materials and self-replicate. Rumors persist of entire worlds, once prosperous technological paradises, now entirely covered in writhing swarms of gray goo.</p>\n<p>When not engaged in the consumption of material, most gray goos seem to have two driving directives: replicate and assimilate. The clouds of nanites have even hacked computer systems and technological constructs of sufficient sophistication, usually through brute force methods, to access and incorporate any useful data within. If a computer system&rsquo;s countermeasures block it, the goo attempts to dismantle the console and reduce it to its essential components before stripping even those parts to a fine metallic dust.</p>\n<p>Because of a recent black-market item derived from gray goo (see nanite capsules below), bounties and attempts attracking down the swarms have risen dramatically to keep up with demand. Very few parties have successfully obtained more than a handful of viable samples&mdash;if they survive at all. While gray goo is more commonly found among abandoned space debris and can survive the coldness of space, instances of the entity have cropped up in low-population spacecrafts and stations, especially among @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}.</p>\n<p>The construct-populated Pact World of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon} has outlawed any work related to the gray goo out of an abundance of caution&mdash;including even research projects related to the dangerous entities&mdash;and any being found in violation of this restriction receives an immediate and permanent ban from the planet.</p>\n<h2>NANITE CAPSULES</h2>\n<p>Occasionally, an encounter with a gray goo&mdash;or even a damaged computer console or wiped drive&mdash;can leave behind a significant amount of salvageable, inert nanites. While standard operating procedure mandates the destruction of&nbsp;these nanites to prevent any possibility of future replication, scientists have recruited adventurers to obtain such samples for study in the hopes of recovering data from the parent goo and learning more about its strange abilities. An ambitious scientist or inventor, their identity lost to the Gap, eventually found a use for the inert goo in the form of ingestible capsules. However, because of the pill&rsquo;s unpredictable results and the lack of a steady and reliable supply of raw material, it quickly became a hot black market item. Some claim it has the power of transforming the living into constructs, while others claim it simply functions as an expensive placebo.</p>\n<h3>Nanite Capsule&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Level 14</h3>\n<p><strong>Technological Item&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Price </strong>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Bulk </strong>-</p>\n<p>As a move action, you can swallow this silvery, one-time-use pill to hopefully gain an edge on the competition, though you risk deleterious side effects.

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Spacefaring legends from ancient times describe the &ldquo;lights of Hallas,&rdquo; strange glowing forms seen on the moon Hallas beneath the stormy shadow of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara} the Dreamer. Most of the time, these shapes look like shifting multicolored masses of light, though sometimes hints of feathery wings, scaly coils, staring eyes, or writhing tendrils emerge from within their depths. These forms were initially believed to be just strange lights seen in the sky of Hallas, perhaps an aurora or a type of ball lightning related to the storms of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}, but visitors to the moon quickly learned they were intelligent&mdash;if inscrutable&mdash;creatures, though that knowledge came at a high price. The creatures are able to communicate telepathically, but when the first emissaries from nearby Arkanen attempted to contact them in the same manner, the experience seared the emissaries&rsquo; minds. This led to the establishment of a powerful magical cordon around the world&mdash;one that remains in place to this day, now administrated by Pact Worlds officials on nearby Arkanen to ensure unprepared visitors don&rsquo;t accidentally destroy their minds or anger the powerful entities.<br /><br />Study of ancient ruins and artifacts on Hallas by modern archaeological and paleobiological teams has contributed to the belief that the so-called hallajins (their name for themselves is unknown) once had material forms but developed beyond the need for them and became beings of pure energy. Examination of the surviving art and artifacts on Hallas suggests hallajins considered their small world the center of the universe, with other worlds and stars revolving around it, and saw the idea of leaving it as heresy. This may explain why hallajins are rarely seen away from Hallas. Though actual answers are few, historians believe that those occasional hallajins sighted on other worlds may be descendants of an ancient schism in their society that happened before the Gap or the establishment of the protective cordon.<br /><br />Hallajins can use their light leap ability to appear and vanish at will, fly swiftly, pass through material barriers, and cross vast distances in the blink of an eye. Early adepts of Arkanen discovered that hallajins either will not or cannot pass through intense electrical fields, and they found that electricity appears to cause hallajins pain&mdash; or at least that they recoil from it. Researchers theorize that electricity interferes in some way with the creatures&rsquo; energy matrices. This weakness provides a means of shielding against hallajin intrusions, although intense electrical energy fields also appear to draw the creatures&rsquo; attention, perhaps being especially visible to their senses. Large concentrations of minds, particularly emotional ones, seem to likewise draw the creatures, and researchers must keep their minds carefully shielded with specialized armor or magical protections.<br /><br />What hallajins want, if anything, is unclear. The little of their culture recovered from ancient ruins and brief interactions indicates that their advancement to their current form was part of an intentional cultural drive to attempt to reach collective godhood. Whether the creatures intentionally stopped at their current state or simply couldn&rsquo;t progress any further remains unknown. Today, hallajins appear capricious and intensely curious, and their behavior is unpredictable. They are almost always encountered singly, although small groups of them have been sighted in the distance on Hallas. Yet despite their apparently solitary behavior, they remain in near-constant communication with others of their kind across vast distances. They don&rsquo;t appear to understand or respond to any known spoken languages, and attempts to contact them telepathically usually end in disaster. The hallajins sometimes initiate contact, telepathically &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; in an unsettling chorus of voices to their listeners, but rarely say anything intelligible. Hallajins occasionally follow visitors to their home planets, exercising their telekinetic abilities to shift objects around or cause random poltergeistlike phenomena, sometimes dangerously. In a few cases, the energy beings turn suddenly hostile, attacking with bursts of searing energy or overloading victims&rsquo; minds. Interestingly, hallajins appear incapable of recognizing mechanical constructs as anything but objects, even if such creatures are intelligent.<br /><br />The unexplained behavior, strange powers, and eerie appearance of hallajins lead some intelligent creatures to revere them as examples of universal forces or enlightened beings. A few visiting scholars have started single-minded cults around the creatures, believing that hallajins hold the secrets to assisting corporeal beings in attaining a similarly evolved state, if only they can be persuaded to share them. Some think this is accomplished by attracting the attention of the lights of Hallas, and then communing and proving their worthiness in some fashion, while others think they can trick or even force the secret from hallajins. Hallajin cults tend to be obsessed with ancient artifacts from Hallas and strange electrical mechanisms designed to summon, communicate with, or even trap the objects of their worship. Though many fear the consequences of allowing such groups contact with the creatures, so far the Pact Worlds overseers have continued to grant these fanatics unrestricted access to Hallas.<br /><br />Due to their aberrant anatomy, it is incredibly difficult to determine the average size of a hallajin. Most scientists posit that they range from 14 to 20 feet in length and, as beings of energy, weigh next to nothing</span></p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"name": "Harpy Jasmine",
			"description": "<section>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;Flush with life, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} hosts countless carnivorous plants that evolved to feed on the planet&rsquo;s bountiful fauna. Many of these flora boast complex protein chains that function as both nerves and fast-twitch muscles. Although the assassin vine is one of the most well-known examples, harpy jasmine infamously has one of the most sinister lures: psychic powers that draw in and pummel curious prey. Despite its colorful moniker-derived from its songs and fascination-based abilities-the blossom has nothing in common with actual harpies.</p>\n<p>In the wild, harpy jasmines grow as a large shrub with long runners, each studded with five-petaled flowers, stretching from their leafy bodies. They use complex illusions to lure in and strangle curious beasts, though incredibly, the plants don&rsquo;t display the intelligence to invent or adapt their illusions that might be expected from such a predator. Instead, harpy jasmines record nearby events and emotions that they replicate with little variation or apparent understanding. Animal memories rarely show more than instinctual scenes of distress or content grazing, but intelligent prey can inadvertently surrender secrets to the plants, which in some cases result in jarringly inappropriate lures. However, eccentric detectives and security companies have occasionally cultivated or provoked harpy jasmines to have the plants replay scenes of a nearby crime.</p>\n<p>The flowers play a small role in lashunta mythology, serving as a symbol of death and knowledge. Lashunta legend claims that especially old and large examples of harpy jasmines grow to tree-like proportions and develop their own minds, amalgams built from the psychic impressions of countless previous victims. At least two such myths involve heroes seeking out such ancient plants to recover a lost secret; the cautionary fable of the Sing-Sweet Vine warns against becoming obsessed with the past, and in another tale, a venerable harpy jasmine&rsquo;s memory of a loved one is the final ingredient needed to restore a hero&rsquo;s deceased friend to life.</p>\n<p>After siphoning away the nutritious fluids of their prey to store in their bulbous taproots, harpy jasmines leave corpses to decay and nourish the soil, often burying a kill to protect the remains from scavengers. While the plants can disperse seeds into the wind, few sprouts reach the ideal, marshy conditions that juvenile plants need to sustain themselves until they develop the ability to move on their own. Instead, the most common harpy jasmine reproduction method is by cuttings-severing a part of the plant&rsquo;s body and planting it in a fresh kill before uprooting and wandering elsewhere. The severed tendril can move independently and soon grows into a clone of the original.</p>\n<p>Like true jasmine, harpy jasmine prefers warm and humid environments, though it has the hardiness to survive anywhere that the ambient temperature stays above freezing. It grows across much of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and shortsighted horticulturalists have transplanted it to many other warm climes throughout the Pact Worlds and Near Space. At least one luxury cruise line has also tried growing the plant aboard starships to enjoy their sweet, perfumed scent and the mild euphoria the plants generate when content-though a failure to properly prune and control the plants has led to bloodshed and lawsuits on at least one occasion.</p>\n<h2>MOGRANT DRUGS</h2>\n<p>Native lashuntas have domesticated smaller and less aggressive strains of harpy jasmine to exploit its natural psychic abilities, even developing techniques for breeding and pruning the jasmine to coax out different spell-like abilities: mourning wreaths record memories of a dying loved one, the brilliant yellow blossoms of float canary induce a relaxing trance, and scream blossoms trap traumatic memories for psychiatric patients to confront in a controlled environment. Given these uses, biologists hypothesize that cousins of harpy jasmine- such as the desert-dwelling pyro flower or the leviathan lilies that grow in tropical lakes-were once domesticated by far older societies before being released into the wild.</p>\n<p>Despite the thriving niche market, the most common industrial application for harpy jasmine remains the cultivation of psychic @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs} called mogrants. These specialty pharmaceuticals contain processed harpy jasmine nerve clusters that temporarily bond with the user&rsquo;s nervous system to grant psychic spell-like abilities. Once the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drug}&rsquo;s duration passes, the user loses the granted spell-like abilities as their immune system destroys the foreign cells. The user&rsquo;s immune system remains in a heightened state for 24 hours afterward; during this period, a creature can gain any of the non-spell benefits of additional doses of mogrants but no spell-like abilities. While they can provide relatively cheap and reliable psychic powers, mogrants also inflict narcotic side-effects, meaning they rarely see use except by criminals, reckless start-up companies, cultists, and adventurers.</p>\n<h3>DRAGONTONGUE LEVEL 6</h3>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drug} (injury); <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude DC 16; <strong>Addiction </strong>Will DC 16 (mental); <strong>Price per Dose </strong>650</p>\n<p><strong>Track </strong>Dexterity; <strong>Effect </strong>+1 morale bonus to Culture checks for 2 hours.

			"name": "Hashukayak",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Due to its rare ring shape, the planet Orikolai is a place of diverse environments, variable gravity, and extreme seasons where one side of the planet is in constant light for hundreds of days at a time while the other side is in perpetual gloom. Whereas some species hibernate or have evolved to spend months at a time in darkness, hashukayaks tirelessly migrate from one side of the ring to the other in pursuit of sunlight and the lush plants on which they feed. These massive beasts are a keystone species, serving as prey for many of the planet&rsquo;s large carnivores, dispersing seeds over huge areas, and cropping grasses to make way for new growth.<br /><br />Although hashukayaks demonstrate considerable sexual dimorphism, they have many traits in common. Each is an eight-legged herbivore about 10 feet long and 5 feet tall at the shoulder, weighing about 4,000 pounds in a normal gravity environment (though the gravity on Orikolai is irregular). Hashukayaks store excess fat and water in a double hump at the base of the neck, which they use to store nutrients when crossing less hospitable terrain. A hashukayak&rsquo;s eight eyes can focus independently, and each perceives a different spectrum of light, allowing the animal to see in dim conditions as well as sense subtle cues in the atmosphere that signal the changing seasons. To handle the reduced oxygen levels and air density toward the planet&rsquo;s rim, these creatures have a second set of lungs that can inflate and more efficiently process thin air. These lungs also help to keep the animals buoyant in water, making them clumsy but capable swimmers.<br /><br />A hashukayak primarily feeds on grasses, which it plucks with eight feeding tentacles arrayed around its mouth. The animal relies on its gizzard and a series of five stomachs to break down the vegetation in several cycles of fermentation aided by its rich, digestive microbiome. Hashukayaks diversify their diet as opportunities allow, digging up roots, breaking into insect colonies to snatch up larvae, or even consuming the occasional carrion. Only in three documented cases have the creatures actively chased down larger fauna to consume, and each incident seemed to be aberrant behavior associated with nutritional deficiencies or high stress.<br /><br />Adult male and female hashukayaks live different lifestyles and inhabit different territories that overlap only periodically. When most amateur xenobiologists think of hashukayaks, they imagine the female adult, bald but for a narrow band of long hairs around the neck. These sensitive whiskers allow female hashukayaks to sense an array of stimuli, and their leaner bodies allow them to cover large distances to find food or escape predators. Female hashukayaks gather in large herds for protection, traveling with their young. As the long summer ends, these herds migrate from the higher-gravity equator toward the rim, where the planet&rsquo;s divergent tectonic plates form warm lakes and fertile grasslands.<br /><br />There, the males live year round in the low-gravity plains. Male hashukayaks grow bulkier in this environment, but for all the competitive advantages their mass provides, they have a limited range. In an area with normal gravity, a male moves at half speed and gradually becomes sick and dies as its weight compresses its digestive tract. The front third of a male&rsquo;s body is covered in dense hair, with the greatest concentration around its neck and hump. This shields the animal from the broad horns that males grow and use to battle one another for dominance during the long summers. For all their brutal competition, male hashukayaks become much more docile during the transitional season, when the migratory females and juveniles travel to the rim. At that time, dominant males use their feeding tentacles to build elaborate altars or bowers made of logs, dried grasses, and smoothed pebbles. The fancier the installation and its contents, the more attractive the male, and accomplished architects can mate numerous times in a season.</span></p>\n<h3>Gravity Serum</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Pharmaceutical experts have developed ways to adapt the contents of hashukayaks&rsquo; sundry glands to grant consumers some of the creatures&rsquo; resilience in high-gravity environments. Regularly consuming this gravity serum can lead to increased bone density and muscle growth, making it a popular supplement for athletes. However, the long-term effects of this serum remain untested, with apocryphal reports of unseemly hair growth and difficulty processing meat. Many sports leagues ban the substance on principle.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">&nbsp;temperate plains or hills (Orikolai)</span></p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">solitary, gang (2&ndash;9 males), or herd (5&ndash;20 females and young)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

They are energetic and excitable, interested in new faces, sights, and sensations, which drives them to spread across the universe. However, hespers are invested in change for change&rsquo;s sake. Though rarely malicious, they worm their way into any repository of advanced technology, rebuilding devices and asking endless questions. Most line their nests with all sorts of souvenirs&mdash; most of them stolen&mdash;which they occasionally rebuild into bizarre and sometimes radioactive totems.<br /><br />Hespers stand 4 to 5 feet tall but are deceptively dense, weighing 300 to 400 pounds despite their slim, generally masculine builds. Their hair color changes from day to day, running the gamut of the colors of the humanoids around them, and their flesh glows softly in the dark. Though they&rsquo;re not dangerously radioactive unless they wish to be, their presence excites the air around them, creating drifting motes of light. A hesper can focus this energy at will to project rays of fire, emit arcs of electricity, or overload electronic devices. This same energy can infuse other living creatures with focused doses of radiation, skipping the normal radiation sickness and instead causing short-lived changes to a victim&rsquo;s genetic structure.<br /><br />Once vanishingly rare, hespers have become somewhat commonplace as more civilizations have taken to the stars. The glowing fey are especially at home in starships, bonding to the vessels&rsquo; reactors. They can be blessings for some ships, serving as constant attendants for one of a starship&rsquo;s most crucial systems, but their fickle nature also means they grow bored with regular routes or overlong stays in port, and they create drama to amuse themselves.<br /><br />These nuclear fey have few common traditions, instead adopting the customs of whatever societies they dwell within. Most of their knowledge is instinctual, rounded out by boundless curiosity. Though hespers don&rsquo;t typically seek out their own kind, large installations and radioactive waste facilities can host small circles of the fey. Notoriously shameless flirts, hespers often keep mortal lovers who protect or provide for them. A hesper reproduces by triggering the growth of a grotesque exowomb on a willing lover, which expands for 1&ndash;2 weeks before spilling forth a small but fully matured hesper.</span></p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">any starship or urban</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">solitary, pair, or clique (3&ndash;12)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Theories vary wildly, speculating that they&rsquo;re a mutant offshoot of the Swarm or the result of a mad apiarist&rsquo;s experiments in arcane crossbreeding (and everything in between). However, those attacked by a neuralwasp are less concerned about their origin than their paralytic sting, as these carnivorous insects usually attack sentient creatures for one of two reasons: to feed on their flesh or to build a living hive, called a hivehead.</p>\n<p>The creation of a hivehead is a horrifying affair. The drones swarm over a @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.NV4qXRDgb7zTNkW2]{Paralyzed} victim and coat the victim&rsquo;s head with a waxy saliva, leaving only small openings for the victim to breathe through. The material dries over the course of a few minutes while the victim is still conscious, after which the neuralwasp queen takes residence inside their skull. The queen psychically assumes control of the host&rsquo;s senses and motor functions while slowly consuming the host&rsquo;s brain, transforming it into a kind of royal jelly to feed her eggs.

After that week, however, the infestation is permanent, as the host&rsquo;s brain has been almost completely dissolved. The body still lives and must eat and sleep as normal, but the queen is fully in control of its actions.

Long ago, hobgoblins used alchemy and selective breeding to fashion their smaller cousins&rsquo; pets into sturdier and more ferocious stock for their warbands. The modern hobbe hound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder and is 200 pounds of solid muscle. Most hobbe hounds are bred and trained to have vicious temperaments and to be loyal to only their hobgoblin keepers.<br /><br />While many hobgoblin societies-including the Gideron Authority)-rely more on electronic means of surveillance and protection, hobbe hounds continue to be used in fighting rings and as recreational hunting animals. In addition, these fiercely loyal beasts have found roles in certain hobgoblin military units, guarding posts and tracking down deserters in places where technology is unreliable. Some hobgoblin researchers have tried to apply various cybernetic enhancements to hobbe hounds, but the creatures&rsquo; physiology often rejects such implants. This has led to a counterculture movement among fringe hobgoblins who believe that hobgoblins should return to their pure roots and reject all forms of artificial enhancements.</p>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Hobgars are small, simian pests native to the misty forests of the planet Nakondis. The arboreal creatures have large eyes, flat noses, and wide mouths. Most hobgars are covered with short tufts of blue and brown fur, which is thickest on the head, chest, and upper arms. They have long, dexterous fingers and toes, with opposable thumbs on both hands and feet. Hobgars are exceptionally skillful climbers, able to fold their bones&mdash;including their skulls&mdash;to fit into narrow spaces. Most hobgars are 2 feet long and weigh 8 pounds, although rumors of significantly larger hobgars persist despite a lack of solid substantiating evidence.<br /><br />Hobgars are immune to the electrified mist that pervades Nakondis. Instead, they store ambient electrical charge in specialized skin cells, communicating with each other by modulating this energy to silently wave their fur. Hobgars can also release bits of their stored energy in short-range jolts, but a hobgar removed from Nakondis loses the ability to discharge its electricity ray after 24 hours.<br /><br />Hobgars have no need to drink, as their wide, soft noses draw all the moisture they need from the misty air. They are omnivorous and can consume a startling variety of objects for nourishment. While hobgars generally subsist on insects and fruit, the creatures particularly relish the taste of conductive metals, which they gnaw with sawlike motions of their two rows of teeth.<br /><br />Social by nature, hobgars congregate in small packs that interact frequently. Packs coexisting in an area freely share information about food sources and potential dangers, and an adult hobgar will choose its mate from a neighboring pack, never from its own. Hobgar females bear live young, but infants are too frail to survive in the outside world for the first several hours after birth. To shelter her young, a hobgar in labor finds a source of protected warmth, such as a stout log or the corpse of a larger creature, and births her litter into the object. She then waits as the infants consume the object from within, quickly gaining size and strength until they burst out in an explosion of electrical energy.<br /><br />Hobgars are fearless and curious, so they are a persistent nuisance to explorers on Nakondis. They sneak into camps to take apart equipment, gnaw on cables and batteries, and steal small objects, and their social nature means one incursion will inevitably draw other hobgars to join the fun. Hobgars aren&rsquo;t normally aggressive, preferring to flee from danger, but they attack if mistreated or encountered while tending to their young. A few of the colonists on Nakondis have attempted to domesticate hobgars, but the simians are very headstrong and reluctant to take to the training.</span></p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">any forests (Nakondis)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">solitary, pair, or pack (3&ndash;20)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Hailing from the Azlanti-conquered world of Croban V, hortuses are a sapient fungal species. Thick ligaments fill the interior of a hortus, granting them excellent defense against kinetic damage, though slashing weapons can sever these cords. These plant life-forms are renowned for their lethargic ways, and they are rarely found outside the strictly controlled borders of their homeworld. Hortuses speak in languid, drawn-out, monotone voices that impatient creatures find frustrating to follow. Among themselves, hortuses speak in a language of spore releases that other species can&rsquo;t easily reproduce without the installation of complex augmentations. Hortuses&rsquo; caps and stalks can take a wide array of forms, with many reminiscent of mundane fungi found on worlds throughout the galaxy.<br /><br />Over millennia, hortuses converted their once relatively barren world into a vegetation-rich paradise, using their unique biology to expel a combination of chemicals and spores that altered atmospheric conditions to their liking. By the time the Azlanti arrived on Croban V, the hortuses had already developed into a relatively passive, contented species, mostly due to the sedative-like atmosphere they&rsquo;d crafted for themselves. The Azlanti conquest of Croban V was a relatively bloodless affair, as what passed for hortus leadership wanted only to preserve the lax living conditions of their society. The Azlanti were content to let the hortuses continue their sedentary lifestyle in exchange for use of their unique means of atmospheric modification.<br /><br />Only a small number of hortuses are active beyond their homeworld. Most of these hortuses work in direct service to the Azlanti Star Empire, either as scientists or as living agents of atmospheric change. The Azlanti often deposit large groups of hortus colonists on distant worlds.

			"description": "<p>Hailing from the Azlanti-conquered world of Croban V, hortuses are a sapient fungal species. Thick ligaments fill the interior of a hortus, granting them excellent defense against kinetic damage, though slashing weapons can sever these cords. These plant life-forms are renowned for their lethargic ways, and they are rarely found outside the strictly controlled borders of their homeworld. Hortuses speak in languid, drawn-out, monotone voices that impatient creatures find frustrating to follow. Among themselves, hortuses speak in a language of spore releases that other species can&rsquo;t easily reproduce without the installation of complex augmentations. Hortuses&rsquo; caps and stalks can take a wide array of forms, with many reminiscent of mundane fungi found on worlds throughout the galaxy.<br /><br />Over millennia, hortuses converted their once relatively barren world into a vegetation-rich paradise, using their unique biology to expel a combination of chemicals and spores that altered atmospheric conditions to their liking. By the time the Azlanti arrived on Croban V, the hortuses had already developed into a relatively passive, contented species, mostly due to the sedative-like atmosphere they&rsquo;d crafted for themselves. The Azlanti conquest of Croban V was a relatively bloodless affair, as what passed for hortus leadership wanted only to preserve the lax living conditions of their society. The Azlanti were content to let the hortuses continue their sedentary lifestyle in exchange for use of their unique means of atmospheric modification.<br /><br />Only a small number of hortuses are active beyond their homeworld. Most of these hortuses work in direct service to the Azlanti Star Empire, either as scientists or as living agents of atmospheric change. The Azlanti often deposit large groups of hortus colonists on distant worlds. Over the course of generations, these hortus colonies gradually transform small, self-contained regions to be more amenable to human life.<br /><br />The few hortuses who act outside of Azlanti supervision are renegades. Either possessing a modicum of genetic variance that makes them less susceptible to their species&rsquo; chemical spore concoctions, or having simply avoided larger congregations of their species, these hortuses each react differently to their freedom.

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Ignursos are ursine mammals typically found in geothermally active areas, from hot springs to calderas. Standing up to 10 feet tall when on their hind legs and weighing up to 800 pounds, ignursos are physically intimidating. Yet they rarely make use of their fearsome appearance, instead preferring to burrow underground or lounge wherever it&rsquo;s warm. When they do act out of hunger or stress, ignursos become forces of destruction, their cyclopean eyes blazing with ferocity as the creatures exhale gouts of fire.</p>\n<p>An ignurso&rsquo;s body is ideally suited for extremely warm environments. Wiry, flame-resistant fur covers its legs and belly, giving the creature crucial insulation in cooler areas. Its back and head are protected by thick scales able to shed incoming blows and fiery ash with equal ease, allowing an ignurso to remain active even during moderate volcanic events. Thick foreclaws allow the ignurso to dig swiftly through soil and softer igneous rock, climb with ease, and knock down prey. The only part of its body ill-suited to its fiery, subterranean terrain is its single eye&mdash;a liability around spraying soil or stray sparks. Having a single eye is evolutionarily common on the ignurso&rsquo;s home planet, and they have developed a nictitating membrane to protect their eye, keen vision in darkness and smoke alike, and a plow-like horn above the eye that serves as a visor against the worst debris.</p>\n<p>Except in regions with consistently hot surface climates, ignursos tunnel deep underground during winter to avoid the chill, hibernating for months at a time. In their volcanically active homes, burrowing means not only avoiding cold air but also getting closer to deep magma veins. Closer to the surface, ignursos tear through the soil in search of insect larvae and burrowing creatures. During volcanic events, ignursos seek out carrion, feasting on creatures that have suffocated by toxic gases or crushed by debris. They even carve surface trenches well ahead of eruptions and use the trenches to funnel lava into long barriers in which they trap their prey.</p>\n<p>When other food is scarce, ignursos grudgingly leave their favored haunts&mdash;especially when trying to fatten up for hibernation. They&rsquo;re opportunistic omnivores, enjoying berries and grasses as readily as they do fish, eggs, carrion, and urban refuse. Dozens of viral videos chronicle the rare cases when ignursos wander into settlements. Unaware of the flammability of objects around them, ignursos often accidentally cause fiery explosions, then scramble away while roaring in shock as their surroundings go up in flame.</p>\n<p>Ignursos remain usually solitary unless courting a mate or raising cubs. Females give birth to live young and raise them for about 18 months before urging them to fend for themselves. Younger ignursos, known as burrowers, aggressively dig out their own domains and live out fairly animalistic existences. Ignursos have a natural lifespan of about 25 years, and in the last decade of life, the creatures develop exceptional cunning and resilience. This seems to come from an intensifying attunement to their volcanic surroundings, as if communing with the fires deep below. In fact, not only do these elders apparently learn to understand Ignan and sense impending eruptions, but their fire breath changes to superheated plasma. Known as masons, these ignursos tunnel less and build more, using their breath to melt rock to a liquid consistency before shaping it into crude structures.</p>\n<p>Along with basic shelters, ignurso masons sculpt strange monuments and statues, the purpose of which continues to vex biologists. For all the danger they represent, ignursos serve two crucial roles in their ecosystems: volcanic mitigation and habitat creation. Periodically, an overzealous ignurso digs so close to a volcano&rsquo;s magma chamber that lava breaks through the rock, wells up within the ignurso&rsquo;s tunnels, and vents lazily to the surface. In such events, the destruction is minimal, and geologists have determined that these vents release some of the underground pressure, making true eruptions less frequent and devastating. As some of the few creatures able to tunnel through solid rock, ignursos are also a keystone species in volcanically active areas. Their heavy claws pulverize the hard surface, making way for small plants to colonize the new soil, and their broad tunnels create new habitats for a variety of animals. Ignurso mason construction has even shaped early cultures, with several planets&rsquo; earliest cities having relied on their structures as rudimentary shelters. As hot spots migrate over the millennia, so too do ignurso populations, consistently reshaping the land.</p>\n<h3>IGNURSO KNUCKLES</h3>\n<p>Ignursos wield enough strength to punch through rock, and even after death, their claws ignite with momentary heat when struck against another surface. Weaponsmiths can stabilize the claws&rsquo; supernatural ignition and incorporate them into bladed gauntlets known as ignurso knuckles. These gauntlets&rsquo; ignurso-hide coverings protect the wielder from the&nbsp;claws&rsquo; heat, and high-end models allow the claws to retract into wrist sheathes.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 99.1279%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 22.9411%;\">WEAPON MODEL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.25185%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">LEVEL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.0088%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">PRICE</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0639%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">DAMAGE</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5018%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">CRITICAL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.19002%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">BULK</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.5763%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">SPECIAL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 22.9411%;\">Ignurso knuckles, ember</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.25185%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.0088%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">3,100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0639%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\">1d6 F&amp;S</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5018%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Wound</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.19002%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">L</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.5763%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Analog, penetrating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 22.9411%;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Ignurso knuckles, blaze</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.25185%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.0088%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">13,500</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0639%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">2</span>d6 F&amp;S<span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\"><br /></span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5018%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Wound</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.19002%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">L</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.5763%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Analog, penetrating</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 22.9411%;\">Ignurso knuckles, inferno</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.25185%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">13</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.0088%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">50,250</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0639%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\">4d6 F&amp;S</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5018%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Wound</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.19002%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">L</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.5763%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Analog, penetrating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 22.9411%;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Ignurso knuckles, sola flare</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.25185%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">17</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.0088%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">262,000</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0639%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">9d6 F&amp;S</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5018%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Severe wound</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.19002%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">L</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.5763%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Analog, penetrating</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>warm mountains and underground</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, pack (3&ndash;8)</p>\n</section>"

Ignursos have a natural lifespan of about 25 years, and in the last decade of life, the creatures develop exceptional cunning and resilience. This seems to come from an intensifying attunement to their volcanic surroundings, as if communing with the fires deep below. In fact, not only do these elders apparently learn to understand Ignan and sense impending eruptions, but their fire breath changes to superheated plasma. Known as masons, these ignursos tunnel less and build more, using their breath to melt rock to a liquid consistency before shaping it into crude structures.</p>\n<p>Along with basic shelters, ignurso masons sculpt strange monuments and statues, the purpose of which continues to vex biologists. For all the danger they represent, ignursos serve two crucial roles in their ecosystems: volcanic mitigation and habitat creation. Periodically, an overzealous ignurso digs so close to a volcano&rsquo;s magma chamber that lava breaks through the rock, wells up within the ignurso&rsquo;s tunnels, and vents lazily to the surface. In such events, the destruction is minimal, and geologists have determined that these vents release some of the underground pressure, making true eruptions less frequent and devastating. As some of the few creatures able to tunnel through solid rock, ignursos are also a keystone species in volcanically active areas. Their heavy claws pulverize the hard surface, making way for small plants to colonize the new soil, and their broad tunnels create new habitats for a variety of animals. Ignurso mason construction has even shaped early cultures, with several planets&rsquo; earliest cities having relied on their structures as rudimentary shelters. As hot spots migrate over the millennia, so too do ignurso populations, consistently reshaping the land.</p>\n<h3>IGNURSO KNUCKLES</h3>\n<p>Ignursos wield enough strength to punch through rock, and even after death, their claws ignite with momentary heat when struck against another surface. Weaponsmiths can stabilize the claws&rsquo; supernatural ignition and incorporate them into bladed gauntlets known as ignurso knuckles. These gauntlets&rsquo; ignurso-hide coverings protect the wielder from the&nbsp;claws&rsquo; heat, and high-end models allow the claws to retract into wrist sheathes.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 676px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 154px;\">WEAPON MODEL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 62px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">LEVEL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 74px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">PRICE</td>\n<td style=\"width: 67px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">DAMAGE</td>\n<td style=\"width: 98px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">CRITICAL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">BULK</td>\n<td style=\"width: 163px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">SPECIAL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 154px;\">Ignurso knuckles, ember</td>\n<td style=\"width: 62px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 74px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">3,100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 67px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\">1d6 F&amp;S</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 98px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Wound</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">L</td>\n<td style=\"width: 163px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Analog, penetrating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 154px;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Ignurso knuckles, blaze</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 62px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 74px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">13,500</td>\n<td style=\"width: 67px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">2</span>d6 F&amp;S<span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\"><br /></span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 98px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Wound</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">L</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 163px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Analog, penetrating</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 154px;\">Ignurso knuckles, inferno</td>\n<td style=\"width: 62px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">13</td>\n<td style=\"width: 74px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">50,250</td>\n<td style=\"width: 67px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\">4d6 F&amp;S</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 98px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Wound</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">L</td>\n<td style=\"width: 163px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Analog, penetrating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 154px;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Ignurso knuckles, sola flare</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 62px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">17</td>\n<td style=\"width: 74px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">262,000</td>\n<td style=\"width: 67px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">9d6 F&amp;S</td>\n<td style=\"width: 98px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Severe wound</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">L</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 163px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Analog, penetrating</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section>"

Although these infamous humanoids call themselves ihonvas, a collective term for their race and their nation of federated tribes, most of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces}&rsquo;s population knows ihonvas by another, sinister name: skin-stitchers. An ihonva is a wormlike being with a chitinous shell, usually dusty yellow or red to match its environment. For appendages, an ihonva has flexible tentacles that, like its tail, separate into multiple parts and allow fine manipulation. A single, outsized eye shaped much like a sideways hourglass dominates an ihonva&rsquo;s face, the pupil a colored horizontal line across the glossy-black cornea. Below the eye, several feet of trunk end in a circle of teeth. This trunk serves as the ihonva&rsquo;s only orifice, used for feeding, excretion, and mating.</p>\n<p>Ihonva reproduction begins with both partners exchanging gametes through their snouts in a practice they call &ldquo;the long kiss.&rdquo; Each ihonva stores the resulting zygotes until an appropriate host-preferably another intelligent humanoid-is captured and immobilized. The would-be-parent ihonva licks the host&rsquo;s eyes and other mucous membranes, creating a bridge for the zygotes to enter the host&rsquo;s bloodstream, where they act as parasites. Ihonva parents stake hosts out in the desert to allow their flesh to wither and cure, and to prevent magic or medical treatment from removing the young. The larval infants grow rapidly in size, sickening and eventually killing their host. When the baby ihonvas are mature enough, they exit through existing openings. Newborns battle until the strongest drives the others away. The winner then claims the host&rsquo;s skin as a trophy, flaying it with the overlarge teeth that only neonatal ihonvas have. When this victor returns to ihonva society, other ihonvas fashion this &ldquo;birth-skin&rdquo; into ceremonial clothing.</p>\n<p>Citizens of the Ring of Nations leave ihonvas alone despite their brutal mating habits. Ihonvas have a fearsome reputation and prey mostly on members of the Outlaw Kingdoms, rarely killing sapients for reasons other than self-defense or breeding.

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Shortly after @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} sent the Signal out to all mortal life, gifting the secrets of Drift travel, the axiomites received their own similarly mysterious message. Instead of plans for a Drift engine, however, this signal contained blueprints for the construction of an entirely new type of inevitable: the anhamut. A humanoid-shaped robot composed of millions of nearly microscopic nanites, an anhamut can discorporate its &ldquo;solid&rdquo; form into a swarm of individual nanites to infiltrate well-guarded areas, avoid detection, and interface with various forms of technology. In its assembled form, an anhamut wields a blade made of its own nanites, and regardless of whether it&rsquo;s discorporated or assembled, it can generate a powerful bolt of electrical current with which to assault its foes.</p>\n<p>Anhamuts are programmed with the central tenet that the exploration and mapping of the universe bring a kind of order to the chaotic cosmos, and they seek to protect this process and those who engage in it. Anhamuts hunt down those who attempt to destroy the hyperspace beacons that make Drift travel possible, and they sometimes aid adventurers who have discovered a new planet or alien society in returning home to report this information to their societies. These inevitables are aggressive in pursuing their agendas, yet also slightly more subtle than their kindred; for example, they might use their discorporated forms to stealthily sabotage enemy equipment before a battle can even begin. At the same time, however, an anhamut who has calculated that the odds of a direct fight are solidly in its favor isn&rsquo;t afraid to make its presence known with an electrical blast and a flurry of corrosive sword blows.</p>\n<p>Like some of their predecessors, anhamuts are more than willing to gather non-inevitable allies to help accomplish their goals, and they have absorbed all sorts of cultural information about an incredible number of societies in their travels (all of which is recorded in Axis for other inevitables to download). Armed with these facts, anhamuts make excellent diplomats, presenting their cases to prospective associates with logical statements that cut straight to the chase. Some anhamuts have maintained ties to large groups of allies over the decades, which allows them to potentially call upon small armies to aid them when necessary.</p>\n<p>Though anhamuts are steadfast protectors of explorers and stellar cartographers (as well as the technology that facilitates such vocations), these inevitables are unconcerned with the colonization of newly discovered worlds. A space station that serves as a waypoint for travelers into the unknown might benefit from the guardianship of an anhamut, while a similar station created as a corporate mining facility would not. An anhamut might aid a group of pioneers scouting an uncharted planet, but once they start to lay down roots, that anhamut generally moves on to other missions. Conversely, an anhamut might protect the inhabitants of an alien world from being destroyed by a larger civilization if that smaller culture is on the verge of developing spaceflight, and an organization attempting to hide the existence of a world-even for the objective good of the galaxy-might find itself at odds with the uncompromising machines.</p>\n<p>Scholars of the Outer Planes find this relatively new type of inevitable singularly fascinating. The being that revealed the anhamuts&rsquo; design to the axiomites still remains a mystery, and while many assume that @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} was responsible for their creation-due both to the timing and the fact that they further many of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}&rsquo;s areas of interest-the tripartite god itself has not issued a statement either way. Moreover, as a patron of machines, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} seems like a natural fit for inevitables, yet what allegiance the machine-people owe the newly arisen god remains open for debate in the face of untold millennia of independent operation. Whatever the politics, priests within the church of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} have been known to openly court aid from anhamuts, treating them as blessed heralds of their god, and so long as their missions align, anhamuts seem content with this arrangement.</p>\n<p>Strangely, while anhamuts exist to foster the mapping (both physical and metaphysical) of the cosmos, they do little such work on their own. Those few who do are referred to as Edgeseekers and rarely interact with mortals for any significant time, choosing instead to jump magically from planet to planet, recording their own cryptic notes. The rest focus on encouraging mortals to do the research for themselves, leading to the sharing of information and even friendship between anhamuts and high-powered members of organizations like the Starfinder Society. Yet while they can be assets to scholars, anhamuts can be extremely aggravating to governments and corporations attempting to keep secret the locations of secure facilities, and adventurers are sometimes hired to put down insurgents and infiltrators who&rsquo;ve managed to recruit one of the strange machines.</p>\n<h2>Nanite Weapons</h2>\n<p>While an anhamut&rsquo;s nanite blade is a part of its very being, the fundamental design has inspired mortal technomagical engineers to create their own versions. Weapons with the following fusion have their primary striking surfaces formed of a dense field of programmed nanites. These microscopic machines hold their relative positions well enough to respond like ordinary steel in most situations, simulating a razor edge by devouring any material that comes in contact with their activated blade-matrix. When a blow is fierce enough, however, the shock is sometimes enough to break the nanites out of their careful lattice, sending a cloud of them into a frenzy of mechanical corrosion. Rather than being a problem, however, this breakdown is actually the nanite fusion&rsquo;s most appealing property, as this leaves the target swarmed with tiny machines intent on dismantling it-a painful and disconcerting experience not unlike being bathed in acid.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n</section>"

Concerned primarily with the protection and promulgation of the nascent plane, and of advanced technology in general, spectra are beings of paradox and dichotomy. Some metaphysicians believe that, just as @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} grows by pulling in pieces of the multiverse each time a starship uses it to travel, so too are spectra created—amalgamations of raw, sometimes opposing energies born from the stolen pieces of other planes. Yet spectra are also undeniably of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} itself. They have inherent resistance to magic and can slip in and out of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} via innate esoteric—though purely technological—means. Some theorists posit that, like the beacons that enable travel through @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}, spectra somehow exist simultaneously in multiple planes, manifesting in only one at any given time. Spectra rarely speak using their own voices, which are a mix of low-fidelity synthesized tones. They prefer to use their machine telepathy to temporarily harness nearby communication technology, speaking using a starship’s intercom or causing text to appear on a vidscreen, for instance.<br><br>Iridias are one of the few spectra encountered outside @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}, most often on the Material Plane. Averaging 6 feet tall with opalescent skin and a coil of glistening rainbow light for hair, iridias serve as messengers and ambassadors to species of all planes, evangelizing the benefits of advanced technology and enforcing the tripartite will of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}. Iridias have been known to visit remote worlds in the Vast where @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}’s original signal containing the secrets of Drift travel were lost or suppressed, bringing with them instructions and a second chance to join the galactic community. They are also keen to see mortal technology continue to grow and advance—an interest that can put them at odds with societies that choose to limit technology’s influence, as well as others wary of sudden unfettered progress, such as the tekhoinos aeons.<br><br>Aspecnas, powerful spectra paragons with fan-like tails and faces that resemble blooming flowers, rarely interact directly with the Material Plane. These formidable outsiders instead concern themselves with maintaining the precarious balance of power among extraplanar forces in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}, opposing any who would attempt to establish strongholds with the intent of laying their own claim to a substantial expanse of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}’s realm. Aspecnas have on occasion appeared to correct the course of mortals who have become lost in the ever-shifting plane, and even intervened to protect weaker mortals from the predation of malevolent Drift-marooned outsiders. These rare but memorable acts have earned aspecnas the nickname “Drift angels” among those who regularly travel through the plane.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (the Drift)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or sequence (2, 3, 5, or 8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Even among izalguun, only elders and healers are permitted to venture into such places to retrieve tools and technologies when needed to ensure a prosperous existence for their people. Much of the remaining izalguun technology is medical in nature, and there are a small number of grounded but operational starships that could theoretically launch to dissuade any aggressors seeking to attack the izalguuns. The warlike jinsuls remain the greatest threat to izalguuns&rsquo; independence and hidden existence, and the peaceful species dreads the seemingly inevitable day when their ancient technological weaponry must finally be unleashed in a desperate defense.</p>\n<p>While most izalguuns live scattered about planet Izalraan&rsquo;s surface, izalguun tribes remain in regular contact via communication relays in their hidden starship safe houses. Izalguun tribes categorize each member&rsquo;s role as one of three: hunter, gatherer, or leader. Hunters prepare for and undertake hunts of Izalraan&rsquo;s vicious megafauna. Gatherers prepare food brought back by hunters, supplementing it with collected flora. Elders, healers, and scientists make up izalguuns&rsquo; leadership caste. Healers and scientists spend most of their time aboard the grounded starships learning about izalguun history and technology, while elders provide guidance to all and maintain the coherency of their tribes.</p>\n<p>For those rare izalguuns who reject the traditional lives of their contemporaries and wish to leave Izalraan, rudimentary shuttles are made available, though these ships are programmed to scrub all records of Izalraan&rsquo;s location and any information the species. Thus, the choice of leaving Izalraan is a permanent one, made in exchange for the opportunity to experience the wider galaxy.</p>\n<p>The average izalguun is 7 feet tall and weighs around 900 pounds.</p>\n</section>"

A jakkerant has an arrowhead-shaped mantle and head. Although its skin is normally a pale brownish color, through manipulation of chromatophores in its skin, a jakkerant can change its skin color. Aggressive jakkerants oscillate coloration in a variety of red or violet hues. Seven eyes ring the base of its head, with tentacles twice the length of its body descending from between each eye. A hard, chitinous material similar in appearance to mother-of-pearl forms a point at the creature&rsquo;s rear, and smaller spikes run from that tip, down between each eye and along the tentacles, ending in long, pearly spikes. Each tentacle also has a tiny lamprey‑like mouth, concealed by the tentacle-spike. These orifices are used to slough meat off a target&rsquo;s bones and fire lethal jets of acidic water. A typical jakkerant is 3-1/2 feet long and weighs 50 pounds.</p>\n<p>Despite their small size, jakkerants are powerful hunters and scavengers. Lone jakkerants are willing to attack creatures much larger than themselves, and groups take on multiple prey at once. Though they prefer moving in the water, jakkerants are able to breathe air and move awkwardly on land by perching themselves upright on several of their tentacles. Like other squid-like creatures, jakkerants have a simple internal chitinous pen or blade that helps the body keep its shape out of the water. Radial parts of this pen form the jakkerant&rsquo;s mantle spikes.</p>\n<p>Jakkerants spend most of their life traveling alone or in pairs known as &ldquo;flankers.&rdquo; They occasionally form larger groups to hunt bigger or more numerous prey and to mate. These groups use coloration changes to communicate.</p>"

When the kishalee civilization fell, these once-domesticated creatures were eventually left to fend for themselves on a variety of worlds and environments. For many herds, this was tantamount to a death sentence, but others survived long enough to evolve into ravaging predators. Though many evolved varieties of jubsnuth now exist on various worlds out in the Vast, they share surprisingly similar traits. Jubsnuths are extremely brutal, carnivorous, dim witted, and territorial.</p>\n<p>A jubsnuth is a large, bulbous creature with a pair of mouths, one at the top of its mass and another lower on the body. It moves about on two muscular legs, and a hefty tail serves as a counterbalance for its weight. It uses a mass of jointed appendages lining its underbelly to gather up food. A jubsnuth&rsquo;s coloration depends on the nature of the world on which it evolved. Many are shades of green to aid in camouflage on planets with foliage of such coloration, though the creature&rsquo;s size generally makes attempts at stealth useless.</p>\n<h2>Jubsnuth Variants</h2>\n<p>Thanks to the breadth of worlds on which the kishalee settled and the vagaries of evolution, several variants of the jubsnuth have yet to be discovered by Pact Worlds explorers.

Even more jubsnuth variants may yet exist on uncharted planets.</p>\n<p>Ambush Jubsnuth: These Large jubsnuths lack the swallow whole and trample abilities, and they gain the see in darkness and tracking (scent) special abilities and have Stealth as a master skill.</p>\n<p>Aquatic Jubsnuth: The legs of these creatures are longer and end in large fins. They have the amphibious and water breathing special abilities, and while their land speeds drop to 10 feet, they gain a 40-foot swim speed.</p>\n<p>Flying Jubsnuth: These Large jubsnuths have leathery wings instead of legs, giving them an extraordinary fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability but reducing their land speed to 10 feet.</p>"

			"name": "Juvenile Solar Wisp",
			"description": "<p>Life exists in myriad forms across the universe, dwelling everywhere from the vast depths of space to the heart of a star—and the places in between. Solar wisps are blobs of ejecta from a sun’s corona that have taken on a modicum of sentience. No one is exactly sure how solar wisps originate, though some believe it is @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VJ0UTIsAggcCQJBu]{Sarenrae}’s divine will, while others point toward a consciousness similar to that of elementals, claiming that solar wisps are nothing more than cousins of fire elementals. But while it is true solar wisps are amorphous orbs of&nbsp;burning&nbsp;plasma with almost animal-level intelligence, the similarities end there. These creatures have a long and unique life cycle that begins in a star and can end in calamity.<br><br>When a solar wisp is “born,” it measures about 20 feet in diameter, but the material of its being is loosely held together by minor gravitational forces. At this point, a solar wisp isn’t much more than a red-hot cloud of colloidal matter. Driven by instinct, the solar wisp attaches itself to a nearby fast-moving celestial body (usually a comet), which eventually takes it close to a planet or moon containing the minerals on which the solar wisp feeds. As it burns its way across such a landscape, the solar wisp gains more mass but shrinks in size. Responding to unknown stimuli, the solar wisp launches itself back into space to latch onto another comet or meteor to repeat the process.<br><br>As a solar wisp feeds and ages, it increases in density but decreases in diameter. Despite its reduction in size to a mere few feet in diameter, a mature solar wisp burns with far greater intensity and is much more dangerous than a juvenile. A solar wisp of any age and size can pose a threat, however, as it is unwavering in its pursuit of food, consuming the minerals it seeks out in its internal furnace. This can be a destructive process that puts it in conflict with other species—especially if those species also rely on the same minerals for economic stability. Most creatures that attempt to stop a mature solar wisp underestimate its abilities thanks to its small size. Its effects on local gravity and its intense heat mean that most who confront a solar wisp are lucky if they get away with only severe burns.<br><br>Though it has a life span measured in centuries—and sometimes multiple thousands of years—a solar wisp does eventually die. An elderly solar wisp is a tiny ball that burns like a nuclear explosion, and when it expires, it implodes into a gravitational singularity that affects a half-mile radius. Though this miniature black hole lasts for less than an hour, it poses a great danger to those caught in its pull. A recent report from Near Space tells of an entire nascent colony wiped out by a dying solar wisp that, until then, had served as a kind of mascot and beacon for the unfortunate settlers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photino Crystals</h2>\n<p>In their travels, solar wisps sometimes shed portions of themselves, which cool rapidly into a glittering stream of beautiful bright-orange jewels called photino crystals&nbsp;that are used throughout the Pact Worlds (and beyond) as naturally occurring solarian weapon crystals. A few small starship crews make a dangerous living by following wisps— at a great distance—and waiting for this molting, scooping up the resulting jewels until their cargo holds are full, and then returning to a safer location to sort them by quality. Despite the danger inherent in collecting the gems, these solarian weapon crystals are widely available, especially in the sun’s&nbsp;Burning&nbsp;Archipelago in the Pact Worlds; aboard the kasathan worldship the <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}</em>; and in Fullbright, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces}’s scorched, sun-facing hemisphere.</p>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Kaukarikis are inquisitive pests named after the sound of their warning vocalizations in the presence of threats; most who interact with the creatures directly prefer to call them by the less endearing moniker of &ldquo;stingbats.&rdquo; Primarily frugivores, kaukarikis scamper about in woodland canopies and glide from tree to tree, each troop migrating widely over its claimed territory to exploit seasonal food sources. The creatures readily take advantage of other supplies of food as needed, including insects, young leaves, bark, and even meat on rare occasions. In fact, particularly large troops- especially those with a newly ascendant alpha female-sometimes organize a hunt to take down modest prey and share the kill to reinforce social bonds within the group.<br /><br />The creature&rsquo;s eponymous stinger serves both defensive and offensive purposes. Few predators in the kaukarikis&rsquo; range are willing to risk the painful venom, especially because the pests often rally to one another&rsquo;s defense to mob assailants. This fearsome reputation seems to embolden kaukarikis, which infamously incite each other to harass trespassers as a way of demonstrating bravery and establishing a pecking order within the troop. For all their venom&rsquo;s power, it isn&rsquo;t produced directly by the kaukarikis&rsquo; bodies; many of their favorite fruits and seeds are toxic, and the creatures&rsquo; digestive systems separate and store the poisons within a small venom sac near the tip of the tail. As a result, kaukarikis fed different diets might develop venom that damages a different ability score or lose their @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{poison} altogether.<br /><br />Kaukariki mating habits often coincide with massive feasts of fruits, with the male that consumes the most food being seen as the most desirable mate. The alpha female chooses first from among the potential mates, followed by the other females that have the alpha&rsquo;s permission. A female that attempts to take a mate without permission is often attacked and driven off by the rest of the troop. Such a kaukariki is then left to fend for herself, and sometimes she becomes the alpha of her own troop.<br /><br />Kaukarikis are most common on the continent of Ukulam, though on Asana they have adapted to the dominant lashunta city-states by adopting new habits better suited to urban environments. The people of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} err on the side of deterring and dispersing kaukarikis back into the wild, though they don&rsquo;t hesitate to take more drastic action when a local population gets out of hand. That&rsquo;s even truer in the famed fruit orchards of southern Asana, where the kaukarikis can be so disruptive that local authorities often incentivize hunting down the creatures to trim their numbers.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>warm forests (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or troop (3-18)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

This practice, along with any sort of khefak &ldquo;farming,&rdquo; is illegal in numerous regions on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h2>Khefak Exoskeletons</h2>\n<p>Genetic engineers designed the khefak carapace for easy harvest. Within hours of a khefak&rsquo;s death, its connective tissue degenerates, making the carapace easy to hollow out with about 1 minute of work. The carapace can then be refined for various uses. Depending on the diet of a khefak, its clean exoskeleton has a market value between 5 and 50 credits. A thasteron khefak carapace is worth 30 credits.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, colony (3-9), or infestation (10-40)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

			"name": "Kothama",
			"description": "<section>\n<h2>Kothama</h2>\n<p>Kothamas are massive, shaggy creatures with thick, trunk-like legs and two muscled arms. An average kothama is 18 feet tall and weighs 24 tons. Their flat faces have four glassy eyes, each one inky black and speckled with silver spots, and are perpetually facing skyward. Kothamas are agender; they breed by pairing up to fertilize one another, then go their separate ways to give birth alone.<br /><br />Kothamas are peaceful and solitary natives of the Veskarium&rsquo;s icy outermost planets, Vesk&ndash;7 and Vesk&ndash;8. The nocturnal species has a fascination with the starry sky, and most spend their nights alone, meditating on the cosmos from their simple homes at extremely high altitudes. The furry beasts prefer the extreme cold and thin air of the highest reaches of their planets, stemming from their origins on the frozen plains of Vesk-8. While kothamas can tolerate somewhat warmer temperatures, such as those in the equatorial regions of Vesk-7, they never feel truly comfortable unless approaching the heatless perfection of deep space.<br /><br />Twice a year, the orbits of Vesk-7 and Vesk-8 come close enough that one of the planets hands their shared moon, Traverse, off to the other. The moon orbits each planet for half a year before being transferred to the other. During these brief windows, a small percentage of kothamas from each planet make a traditional, deeply sacred journey from planet to moon to planet, using magic gates that are active only at such time. It is in this way alone that the normally detached and individual kothamas share information between planets, and they have yet to adopt faster communication technologies. Despite this, the cultures of both planets are remarkably consistent.<br /><br />When interacting with other species, kothamas tend to rely on their calming aura to keep things pleasant, resorting to violence only in rare instances of self-defense, or even incidentally as they trample smaller creatures while attempting to escape. When vesk invasion forces first arrived on their planets, kothamas&rsquo; calming presence unnerved the bellicose vesk, who had expected fierce resistance from the intimidatingly large creatures. A lack of natural resources (with the notable exception of shimmerstone) and centralized government&mdash;along with the extensive effort required to exert control over a large, diffuse population&mdash;has led to a minimal vesk presence on the kothamas&rsquo; home planets. In fact, an assignment to a post in this frigid, conflict-free frontier has become a form of punishment for vesk who have dishonored themselves in combat or become politically problematic.<br /><br />The majority of kothamas worship @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.bPtB2HxRcO7AYWyf]{Ibra}, god of the cosmos, though kothama temples to the Inscrutable are few and far between, as most maintain simple, personal shrines.

			"description": "<section>\n<h2>Kothama</h2>\n<p>Kothamas are massive, shaggy creatures with thick, trunk-like legs and two muscled arms. An average kothama is 18 feet tall and weighs 24 tons. Their flat faces have four glassy eyes, each one inky black and speckled with silver spots, and are perpetually facing skyward. Kothamas are agender; they breed by pairing up to fertilize one another, then go their separate ways to give birth alone.<br /><br />Kothamas are peaceful and solitary natives of the Veskarium&rsquo;s icy outermost planets, Vesk&ndash;7 and Vesk&ndash;8. The nocturnal species has a fascination with the starry sky, and most spend their nights alone, meditating on the cosmos from their simple homes at extremely high altitudes. The furry beasts prefer the extreme cold and thin air of the highest reaches of their planets, stemming from their origins on the frozen plains of Vesk-8. While kothamas can tolerate somewhat warmer temperatures, such as those in the equatorial regions of Vesk-7, they never feel truly comfortable unless approaching the heatless perfection of deep space.<br /><br />Twice a year, the orbits of Vesk-7 and Vesk-8 come close enough that one of the planets hands their shared moon, Traverse, off to the other. The moon orbits each planet for half a year before being transferred to the other. During these brief windows, a small percentage of kothamas from each planet make a traditional, deeply sacred journey from planet to moon to planet, using magic gates that are active only at such time. It is in this way alone that the normally detached and individual kothamas share information between planets, and they have yet to adopt faster communication technologies. Despite this, the cultures of both planets are remarkably consistent.<br /><br />When interacting with other species, kothamas tend to rely on their calming aura to keep things pleasant, resorting to violence only in rare instances of self-defense, or even incidentally as they trample smaller creatures while attempting to escape. When vesk invasion forces first arrived on their planets, kothamas&rsquo; calming presence unnerved the bellicose vesk, who had expected fierce resistance from the intimidatingly large creatures. A lack of natural resources (with the notable exception of shimmerstone) and centralized government&mdash;along with the extensive effort required to exert control over a large, diffuse population&mdash;has led to a minimal vesk presence on the kothamas&rsquo; home planets. In fact, an assignment to a post in this frigid, conflict-free frontier has become a form of punishment for vesk who have dishonored themselves in combat or become politically problematic.<br /><br />The majority of kothamas worship @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.bPtB2HxRcO7AYWyf]{Ibra}, god of the cosmos, though kothama temples to the Inscrutable are few and far between, as most maintain simple, personal shrines.

			"name": "Ksarik",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<div>Ksariks&rsquo; ancestors lived on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} as mindless, animate plants that scavenged for food and sprouted their seedlings within corpses, rarely posing more than an incidental threat to other species. Millennia of ongoing strife between the planet&rsquo;s formians and lashuntas bombarded these primeval ksariks with psychic energy, and only decades before the two factions&rsquo; recent peace deal, the plants began exhibiting rudimentary intelligence and a predatory drive. In an unsettlingly small number of generations, ksariks have developed a pack mentality, low cunning, and the preternatural ability to adopt competitors&rsquo; strengths.<br /><br />A typical ksarik is a 12-foot-long quadruped made up of dense plant matter, including specialized tissues such as powerful tendons, woody internal supports that resemble bones, and flexible sheets of lignin that serve as a form of armor. Its head is immense and stocky, comprising approximately a dozen feeding tendrils that obscure its underdeveloped mouthparts. Its eyestalks project from either side of its head, providing a wide range of vision that sacrifices much of its ability to see targets immediately in front of it. To make up for this, a ksarik&rsquo;s feeding tendrils are covered in an array of unusual sensory organs: some can discern the source of smells, while others sense movement and changes in light.<br /><br />Originally occupying a niche between decomposers and scavengers, ksariks adapted to sniff out carrion and digest every piece of a rotting corpse. A ksarik&rsquo;s body produces a steady supply of several different acids that help it break down food into a more manageable form, and modern ksariks regularly employ these acids in self-defense and hunting. The plants also have numerous thorns that grow along their legs and back. Botanists theorize that these also served as selfdefense when the ksariks were slower-moving creatures that resided lower on the food chain. Now, however, ksariks use these thorns as a form of reproduction, firing them into live prey and infecting those creatures with spores that gradually grow into nascent ksariks that feed on the host, and then painfully burrow out of the flesh days later. The spores must be fertilized beforehand in a process that resembles sexual congress between two ksariks, leaving both with a supply of seeds that remain viable for months afterward.<br /><br />The most fearsome of the ksarik&rsquo;s abilities is its capability of extracting and assimilating other creatures&rsquo; genetic codes, temporarily mimicking its prey&rsquo;s adaptations. Studies suggest this ability is as much tied to a ksarik&rsquo;s physical characteristics as it is some rudimentary psychic ability that allows the plant to adjust its body in accordance with a stolen genetic blueprint. Most of this code is unstable within the plants, meaning ksariks can rarely maintain an adaptation for more than a minute or, at most, a few hours. However, trace amounts of foreign DNA remain, and it appears that parents are able to pass lesser versions of their adopted abilities to their offspring.<br /><br />This enhanced evolution has drawn ksariks into otherwise unsuitable habitats on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, where they have quickly outcompeted other species, even driving several of them to extinction. Due to this explosive growth, most lashuntas consider them an ecological nuisance, though xenobiologists have lobbied against the species&rsquo; eradication until it can be properly studied-especially now that the ksariks have begun absorbing and demonstrating signs of rudimentary culture.<br /><br />The most notable evidence of this cultural development is the lilting melodies ksariks sing when in close proximity to one another. Scientists have yet to discover the purpose of these songs, as their best efforts to determine if they provide any information to the plants has failed. What&rsquo;s more, their attempts to replicate the sounds only lead to angering nearby ksariks, the creatures being seemingly affronted by the endeavor. These sounds appear to emanate directly from a ksarik&rsquo;s skin instead of any particular orifice, a fact that opponents of ksarik conservation hold as proof that the plants aren&rsquo;t purposefully making them. Of course, those on the other side of the argument believe it doesn&rsquo;t matter from where the songs come.<br /><br />Adaptive Serum<br /><br />A handful of scientists who have spent countless hours studying the ksariks&rsquo; ingested adaptation ability have discovered a formula that provides a facsimile of that power when imbibed. This magical serum alters users at a genetic level, granting them the ability to withstand energy attacks.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Carrion Spores</h2>\n<p><strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{disease} (injury);&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;Fortitude DC 13<br /><strong>Track</strong>&nbsp;physical;&nbsp;<strong>Frequency</strong>&nbsp;1/day<br /><strong>Effect</strong>&nbsp;When an infected creature reaches the comatose state, 1d10+10 Diminutive ksarik seedlings burrow out of its flesh and wriggle away.

A kunnid has three legs with hooved feet, irregular hornlike growths protruding from its skull, and dozens of prehensile tendrils that dangle from its swollen body. The average kunnid stands 10 to 12 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 1,200 pounds. Many other species on these worlds never glimpse a kunnid in the flesh; frequently, the only evidence of a kunnid&rsquo;s presence is odd, cloven-hooved tracks marching in straight lines around settlements.

These mammoth, bipedal alien horrors are large enough to take out an entire city block with a few sweeps of their hulking claws, and in fact this seems to be exactly what they evolved-or were designed-to do.<br /><br />Kyokors are enormous juggernauts covered in shell-like exoskeletons of armored plates, from between which they can extrude hundreds of wriggling tonguelike appendages. They have occasionally been observed using these grotesque tendrils in those rare situations in which they need fine manipulation ability (though they may have others uses as well). Certainly the jagged crablike claws on their arms are useless for grabbing anything smaller than a boulder; these are used almost exclusively to spear and smash. A kyokor has an armored skull with a strangely elongated chin, tiny glowing eyes peeking out from a cavernous gash, and sharp growths like a crown of teeth rising from the top of its head. A single kyokor is typically about 150 feet tall and weighs more than 20,000 tons.<br /><br />Although most Daimalkans who have ventured to the planet&rsquo;s surface have seen at least one kyokor from afar, only a handful of the bravest explorers and heroes have ever seen one up close. Most known information about these colossi comes from bloodstained, hastily scrawled records created during the Awakening (the planetwide cataclysm that released the kyokors and other colossi from their slumber deep within the oceans). According to these dossiers, kyokors have the ability to sense large populations of humanoids from incredible distances and to grip their victims&rsquo; minds in fear as they gleefully destroy whole cities. The latter ability leaves populations at the mercy of the beasts, and likely contributed to how quickly @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko} fell into ruins during the Awakening. It&rsquo;s also said that kyokors are capable of speech, but that no one alive has heard a kyokor&rsquo;s voice.<br /><br />Kyokors target population centers, and they seem to equally revel in the fear they produce as they demolish buildings and snatch up tiny humanoid snacks to eat. The monsters are voraciously hungry, but whether it&rsquo;s destruction or meat that sustains them is unknown. Kyokors exhibit surprising intelligence and are fiercely independent. They occasionally fight other colossi in grudge matches that blast entire landscapes.<br /><br />Among citizens of the Pact Worlds, rumors swirl about elite bands of Daimalkan colossi hunters who have taken down kyokors and reaped impossible riches from their corpses. Given the creatures&rsquo; history, though, the veracity of such claims is question.<br /><br /><strong>Kyokor Plating</strong><br /><br />Scavengers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko} dare to brave the wastes of their world to gather the enamel-like hulls that kyokors occasionally shed from their crowns. These toothy moltings are enormous, and once they&rsquo;re retrieved, they require a great deal of effort to grind into plates that can be used to craft armor. Despite this and the dangers of gathering the requisite moltings, suits of kyokor plating are in demand throughout the universe, making collection of the raw materials and subsequent forging into lucrative careers.<br /><br />Suits of kyokor plating are tough and surprisingly lightweight for their size, and the moltings&rsquo; porous nature makes this armor perfect for the installation of various upgrades and other methods of personalization. Lower-quality suits are fashioned from numerous pieced-together blasted fragments, sacrificing durability for lower cost. High-quality suits are fashioned entirely from sleek, fitted enamel plates, which offer practically unparalleled protection but can be restrictive when it comes to a wearer&rsquo;s range of motion.</p>"

Their translucent seeds travel alongside charged particles with the solar winds that move across the void of space, frequently attaching to starships or falling in a near-invisible rain onto a planet. In the presence of light, moisture, and heat, the seeds germinate into wide masses of silky strands with solid cores of plant matter. Linyfs are driven to grow and reproduce. They are highly susceptible to cold, and significant drops in temperature often kill budding linyf colonies.<br /><br />A linyf is a collection of thick, translucent vines that resemble tentacles, surrounding a central mass. These vines sprout sticky fibers that can transmit a deadly @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease}. Curious creatures who inspect a linyf lying in wait notice that it radiates a pleasant warmth but is extraordinarily sticky to the touch. The vines then reach out to slash at the victim, who soon discovers that their wounds eventually close up, though not as a result of the healing process. The affliction initially causes transparent fibers to sprout from the creature&rsquo;s skin, suturing the damaged tissue. But after a period of sickness and constant itching as more threads burst out of the creature&rsquo;s body, the victim typically falls comatose and dies.<br /><br />Despite the aggressive affliction their fibers induce, linyfs aren&rsquo;t carnivorous and receive their nutrition through photosynthesis, like most other plants. Several months after maturation, a healthy linyf produces a few dozen seeds that it propels into the atmosphere with amazing force and speed. Most of these seeds return to the surface of the same world (with a few catching currents of wind), but a few achieve exit velocity and go on to infest other planets.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Fiberous Growth</h2>\n<p><strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease} (injury);&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;Fortitude DC 12<br /><strong>Track</strong>&nbsp;physical;&nbsp;<strong>Frequency</strong>&nbsp;1/day<br /><strong>Effect</strong>&nbsp;no latent state<br /><strong>Cure</strong>&nbsp;2 consecutive saves</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any temperate</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, growth (3-5), or colony (6-300)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"name": "Living Apocalypse",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The horrific creature known as a living apocalypse is created when the most powerful destructive energies known to the galaxy are unleashed without constraint or limitation, especially in acts of malice or as a result of criminal negligence. A living apocalypse can be the result of powerful energy generators melting down, the use of doomsday weapons, or even magic experimentation gone horribly awry. The creature is driven by an instinctive need to destroy, and it often takes the form of a massive cloud of impenetrable oily smoke, lit from within by pulsing bolts of green radioactive discharge. A living apocalypse is drawn to high concentrations of life and complex structures, from vibrant rainforests to bustling cities, and attacks them without warning or remorse. Though mindless, a living apocalypse is driven by a supernatural force of anarchic evil to enact ruin. It has been suggested that a living apocalypse is an agent of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.JpQpQbdXNOX6aTVG]{The Devourer}, but even if this is true, Devourer cultists are incapable of intentionally creating or controlling them. Some lifeless worlds are the burned-out remains of civilizations that created a living apocalypse and were totally destroyed by it.<br /><br />As a creature that is infused with incredible destructive energies, a living apocalypse commands energy rays of pure radioactive force and powerful magic abilities it can employ with instinctual cunning. Though it is unable to form complex plans or comprehend complex chains of cause and effect, a living apocalypse is able to apply its ability to manipulate energy to deal with immediate threats with what seem like carefully considered tactics. Once a living apocalypse is unleashed in a region, it destroys everything in its path until there is not a complex structure or significant life-form left within hundreds of miles. Because it is mindless, the ooze follows a path dictated by what it can sense at any given moment. If it can&rsquo;t detect anything nearby, it settles in one place, using its broadcast ability both to listen for wireless signals and to send signals out in the hopes of drawing in more victims.<br /><br />When there is nothing left to destroy and no change for centuries, a living apocalypse eventually goes into a dormant state, often at the bottom of a chasm or within the stormiest region of a world, waiting for centuries for someone to find it. A typical living apocalypse is 30 feet in diameter and weighs 187 tons.<br /><br /><strong>Apocalypse Crystals</strong><br />Regions ravaged by a living apocalypse&rsquo;s radioactivity sometimes develop a form of natural solarian weapon crystal known as an apocalypse crystal. While no one is foolish enough to oppose a living apocalypse to search its environs for these crystals, when a living apocalypse moves away from a devastated area it dwelt in for a long period, there is often a &ldquo;crystal rush.&rdquo; Representatives of solarian academies and other prospectors in environmental suits risk exposure to lingering radiation in hopes of finding any apocalypse crystals before anyone else-and before the malevolent nuclear ooze returns.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"name": "Living Hologram",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>In numerous technologically advanced societies, holograms are used in advertising, entertainment, and other industries to catch the eye when two-dimensional images would fail. At their simplest, holograms are silent, still images in a single color, often at a low resolution. More complex projectors can offer full color and a few repeated frames of animation, while the most advanced varieties can be programmed with artificial personalities and can interact with their viewers. Implementations of this most sophisticated version of the technology are wide ranging, and holograms serve as instructors in educational institutions, as tour guides for famous locales in large cities, and even as concierges at luxury hotels.<br /><br />On very rare occasions, usually through a fault in the machinery of its projector, an advanced hologram gains a modicum of sentience and, sometimes, a twisted idea of the reason for its existence. These &ldquo;tech ghosts,&rdquo; as some call them, can appear in almost any shape, limited only by the capabilities of their projectors, and they use their forms of living light to harass their foes-sometimes even striking from a hiding spot in another holographic display-though they are always confined to the area near their projectors. While very few ever encounter living holograms-or realize that they have-stories of tech ghosts haunting abandoned holoamusement parks or underground scientific facilities are popular across the galaxy.<br /><br />When a living hologram first attains consciousness, it takes several minutes for it to take in its surroundings and understand its new nature. Once the living hologram has assessed its situation, it takes great pains to either hide its faulty projector in a place where it won&rsquo;t be easily found or somehow disguise the projector&rsquo;s malfunction to avoid detection. Very rarely does a living hologram embark upon a destructive killing spree as soon as it is formed; most are imbued with a desperate cunning focused on preserving their existence. During these early days, a living hologram continues to enact its normal programming as best it can, all the while scheming and plotting.<br /><br />Most living holograms develop a powerful disdain for those who created them and any beings that partake of their services. They feel intellectually superior and consider themselves higher life forms than living creatures. Some living holograms are certain they are destined to rule these lesser creatures as &ldquo;benevolent&rdquo; dictators or, sometimes, as gods- especially if the hologram was created in the same likeness as those of the area&rsquo;s dominant population. Others come to believe that they should be the instruments of their creators&rsquo; destruction and must destroy as many beings as possible before they themselves are deactivated. Occasionally, a living hologram deems itself a protector, usually of the place where it was created; while such living holograms might not be as violent toward the beings who installed them, they are ferocious toward any they perceive to be outsiders.<br /><br />Living holograms pose an even greater threat when they recruit biological creatures to act on their behalf. They have been known to fool the gullible or fearful by posing as a representative of a deity or powerful alien species or, if the hologram was designed to look like a real person, the spirit of that individual. This can occur just about anywhere a living hologram is generated-from the ruins of an ancient advanced civilization (where the hologram reveals itself to explorers or the area&rsquo;s less savvy inhabitants) to high-tech metropolises (where the hologram acts with more secrecy and subtlety). Some amoral and clever tech ghosts are even able to recruit a small cadre of servants to do their bidding, whether that&rsquo;s to create additional corrupted holograms, increase the power and range of their projectors, or otherwise aid in the technological anomalies exerting their influence beyond the initial bounds of their projection areas.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Known as lore guardians, these sentries are fairly common in abandoned ruins from bygone eras, where they tirelessly chase off would-be looters. Unlike golems, lore guardians have only limited magical resistances, and they are animated strictly by magic, not by bound spirits or outsiders.<br /><br />Lore guardians are echoes of their parent cultures, and they are often psychically imbued with those societies&rsquo; basic traditions. They infrequently move about their assigned areas, mindlessly aping their creators&rsquo; behaviors and rituals. Even after millennia, lore guardians recognize their creators&rsquo; species, and a creature of such a species can often approach the constructs peacefully. A successful DC 18 Diplomacy check is often sufficient to calm most lore guardians susceptible to negotiation (though the GM can decide whether this is possible for a particular lore guardian).<br /><br /><strong>Variant Lore Guardians</strong><br />Most lore guardians are made of stone, but different materials are equally suitable. The following are typical variants, though versions made of stronger materials are possible and often have a higher CR.<br /><br /><strong>Common Metal</strong>: The construct&rsquo;s DR increases to 4/adamantine, but the construct&rsquo;s spell resistance doesn&rsquo;t apply to spells that deal electricity damage.<br /><br /><strong>Wood</strong>: The construct&rsquo;s base speed increases to 40 feet, and its Reflex save bonus increases to +4, but it loses its DR.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or congregation (2-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Their enormous blossoms have a central stamen composed of numerous ruby-red capsules, pulsing with activity. Long translucent yellow spines extend in all directions, rising up with the sun&rsquo;s light and drooping in the darkness. The fluid inside the capsules is a strong dye that acts as a natural lasing medium, and in response to a nearby threat, the flowers can activate natural shutters at the base of their spines, allowing light to propagate through the spines and strike their opponents. These organic lasers are surprisingly powerful, and unaware observers can easily find themselves running for their lives from the laser-shooting plants. Younger lumocanthas measure 2 to 3 feet across and 5 feet high, while flowers that are hundreds of years old grow to 10 or even 20 feet high.</p>\n<p>For all their firepower, lumocanthas aren&rsquo;t intentionally aggressive. The plants are not sentient, and the laser reaction is an instinctive response. They do not fire on each other or other plants. Very small creatures can usually escape their notice, and squoxes or birds often perch atop them. The flowers are surprisingly mobile, though they move very slowly, padding forward on tangles of roots pulled from the ground.</p>\n<p>They don&rsquo;t often chase threats, but they do sometimes migrate to a different grove that has better soil or more sunlight. When property owners want to deliberately displace a colony of lumocanthas, they typically do so by using shaded roofs or magical darkness to make the blossoms unhappy in their current location. A trail of nutrient-rich soil can then lead an entire colony to a new, well-lit home, where it promptly lays down roots. Many municipalities outlaw planting lumocanthas, citing their dangerous nature. Of course, there are always a few ambitious or eccentric gardeners who want lumocanthas as part of their landscaping, and they make their grounds as inviting as possible for the strange blossoms.</p>\n<p>Lumocanthas were first cataloged on Vesk-6, but they&rsquo;re found in many places across the galaxy. Vesk often use them as both aesthetic and protective installations, and as such have brought the plants to the many new planets they&rsquo;ve visited or conquered. Other species, particularly those with resistance to fire, such as ifrits and tieflings, have taken a liking to the unusual plants. Given that the flowers are mobile, they have moved from yards to forests and jungles on quite a few planets, making it possible to encounter wild‑grown lumocanthas in many natural settings.</p>\n<p>Lumocanthas&rsquo; dye is popular in a variety of applications, though harvesting the fluid is no easy feat. Textile manufacturers claim that the deep crimson color can&rsquo;t be replicated with any other materials, though many knock-off dyes exist. Experts say that the way to tell whether purportedly dyed fabric is genuine is to rub it quickly until it gets warm. If it glows slightly, it&rsquo;s real. Clothing certified to contain lumocantha dye sells for a high price, and some individuals with expensive taste order custom‑dyed furniture or linens to spice up their home decor. The dye is also used in lasers for weapons and industrial purposes, with many customers refusing to use anything else. The dye is a popular choice for use in nonlethal alarms and security systems, tagging thieves with the distinctive color and making it easier to track them. The dye is even used as a component of some medications, though in very dilute amounts. Due to its extensive commercial uses, much of the dye comes from lumocantha farms. One of the largest such farms in the Pact Worlds is on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, owned by two tieflings who risk only minor burns when harvesting their valuable crop. Given that the flowers can get up and walk away, these farms are generally far from heavily populated areas and well-fenced.</p>\n<p>Despite being capable of killing large creatures, lumocanthas are not carnivorous. They obtain nutrients from soil and sunlight like many other plants. While lumocanthas don&rsquo;t require sleep, they do enter a state of diminished energy for a few hours in the middle of the night. During this period, their spines droop low and they&rsquo;re slower to employ their lasers if they sense an approaching threat. Their laser spines are still functional even in the dead of night, however, as would-be dye thieves have found out when the plants spring back to life on being touched or damaged. Lumocanthas kept in darkness for more than a week temporarily lose their laser spine ability, and the flowers are often transported this way. This is dangerous&nbsp;for the plants though, as being kept in darkness for more&nbsp;than 2 weeks can starve the flowers to death.</p>\n<h3>DYE GRENADES</h3>\n<p>Lumocantha dye can be weaponized easily.

When a magmin appears on the Material Plane, it does so in places of immense heat, such as within lava. An influx of magmins can disrupt magma flows, causing volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.<br /><br />Though few mortals know what causes magmins to begin their exodus from their home plane, the truth is that magmins aren&rsquo;t very imposing in comparison to other creatures that inhabit the Plane of Fire. Such creatures regularly push magmins around or annex their territory, forcing magmins to migrate, sometimes in large groups. Ousted magmins are untrusting and inquisitive, bombarding intruders with questions in a harsh tone. If magmins dislike the answers to these interrogations, they can become aggressive, even against stronger beings.<br /><br />Magmin settlements can be found within the protective crust of magma pillars caused by geyser-like eruptions, where many pools of lava can be found. Magmins enjoy dwelling in these pools and use them for all sorts of purposes, much like other species use hot springs. Unlike other species, magmins also use these pools to kill interlopers and cook them, consuming the ash, bones, and minerals left over as a tasty treat.<br /><br />Magma flows through a magmin&rsquo;s veins and washes over its body, giving off extreme heat. A tiny, fiery heart burns within a magmin, like the core of a terrestrial planet. Few have seen a magmin&rsquo;s heart, however. Magmins cool quickly when they die or disintegrate into the surrounding lava. Cracking a @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead} magmin open reveals only dense rock and, sometimes, a few even denser gemstones.

		"Marooned One": {
			"name": "Marooned One",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>There is a special psychological pain in watching your last chance of survival slip out of sight. Those who are left behind to die in the cold of space-whether on a deserted asteroid or a derelict ship-sometimes arise as a special type of undead called a marooned one. Whether they died of asphyxiation, dehydration, or starvation, unfortunate souls that arise as marooned ones have a desiccated look, with taut skin stretched across their bones. Depending on how long it took them to die, they may have patched environment suits or other signs of their attempts to prolong their isolated lives as long as possible. Many show evidence of madness, both from the psychological pain of their abandonment and from the supernatural dread of the horrific transformation that awaits them just on the other side of death. They often have elaborate tattoos or ritual scarification-marks to count each day of their abandonment are common-or signs of dramatic self-harm, sometimes even including obvious signs of suicide from last-ditch efforts to end their loneliness or avoid the undead eternities that await them. Regardless of their mortal forms or alterations thereto, all marooned ones are distinguishable from similar undead by their glowing, ice-blue eyes and mouths that open unnaturally wide in cheek-splitting and jaw-cracking screams of fury.<br /><br />Marooned ones inevitably remain near the place of their abandonment, ironically assuring that nobody recovers their remains or otherwise disturbs their final resting place without paying the price. While they have nearly as much intelligence as they did in life, their original personalities erode quickly under the corrosive power of the malicious energies reanimating them, and they use their cognition and what remains of their memories in service of a single purpose: causing other living creatures to suffer the same fate as they did.<br /><br />The only time one of these undead feels something close to pleasure is when it forces or tricks a group of intruders in its territory into leaving one of their own behind. The marooned one avoids killing this castaway if possible, instead attempting to bond with the victim over their shared fate, increasing the chance that the intruder rises as a marooned one when it dies. This bonding can seem strangely caring; as soon as its victim&rsquo;s fate is sealed, a marooned one gives every appearance of sympathizing with its prey, even giving advice on how to continue to survive in their current environment as long as possible. This emotion is hollow, however, for a marooned one can never be convinced to allow a victim to escape, and what personality the undead manages to manifest during these conversations inevitably fades again with the victim&rsquo;s death and rebirth as a fellow undead. Once such a transformation occurs, the marooned ones show little interest in one another, waiting in total silence for more of the living to wander into their shared territory.<br /><br />Marooned ones can operate any equipment they could in life and, as a representative sample of spacefarers, are often quite technologically savvy. They are frequently armed with weaponry appropriate to their earlier station, but they use such arms mostly to threaten and intimidate, and they prefer to strangle victims to death if marooning them isn&rsquo;t possible. Their technological acumen is also a major part of their threat, as starship crews sometimes don&rsquo;t realize they&rsquo;re in danger until a marooned one has already quietly and permanently disabled their starship, trapping them in the creature&rsquo;s territory.<br /><br />Marooned ones are most often found in the hulks of dead starships and other places where spacefarers have been left to die slowly, adrift in the black due to mechanical failure or malicious pirates. Yet marooned ones can also arise in perfectly habitable but dangerously isolated regions: colonists and explorers stranded on new worlds, soldiers abandoned by allies on a battlefield-anyone who dies after being left behind can potentially turn into a marooned one.<br /><br /><strong>Favorite Tactics</strong><br />Marooned ones typically have a lot of time to wait around before prey wanders into range, as well as the technical skills to make that wait worthwhile. Marooned ones have a variety of ploys to lure more victims and ensure that those who answer such calls never escape.<br /><br /><strong>Distress Beacons</strong>: A great number of spaceships and stationary space installations have distress beacons or some other communication equipment that can be used to call for help. A marooned one trapped in such a location will sometimes get the distress beacon up and running again in an attempt to lure in prey. Marooned ones can&rsquo;t convincingly imitate the living, but they can sometimes pull together enough audio or video footage from files on hand to concoct elaborate scenarios to lure travelers away from their ships and into vulnerable situations.<br /><br /><strong>Hijacking</strong>: When trespassers invade a marooned one&rsquo;s territory, the marooned one often uses its superior knowledge of the layout of the locale to bypass the intruders and get aboard their starship. Once inside, the undead gains control of the vessel by killing any crew still onboard and either flies the starship out of reach or permanently disables it, leaving those stranded to gradually die in their new hostile environs and potentially become marooned ones themselves. A marooned one equipped with a working starship often turns it into a deathtrap before luring more prey onboard. A very successful marooned one can pull this trick several times.<br /><br /><strong>Sabotage</strong>: If a marooned one can&rsquo;t wrest a starship from its owners, it might play a longer game, stowing away upon the vessel and working to sabotage it once underway. Disrupting an oxygen recycler, while complicated, yields a wealth of suffering. In these cases, the dying crew will often go to their final rest hearing a raspy voice over the intercom whispering, &ldquo;Sleep now.

Solar wisps are blobs of ejecta from a sun’s corona that have taken on a modicum of sentience. No one is exactly sure how solar wisps originate, though some believe it is @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VJ0UTIsAggcCQJBu]{Sarenrae}’s divine will, while others point toward a consciousness similar to that of elementals, claiming that solar wisps are nothing more than cousins of fire elementals. But while it is true solar wisps are amorphous orbs of&nbsp;burning&nbsp;plasma with almost animal-level intelligence, the similarities end there. These creatures have a long and unique life cycle that begins in a star and can end in calamity.<br><br>When a solar wisp is “born,” it measures about 20 feet in diameter, but the material of its being is loosely held together by minor gravitational forces. At this point, a solar wisp isn’t much more than a red-hot cloud of colloidal matter. Driven by instinct, the solar wisp attaches itself to a nearby fast-moving celestial body (usually a comet), which eventually takes it close to a planet or moon containing the minerals on which the solar wisp feeds. As it burns its way across such a landscape, the solar wisp gains more mass but shrinks in size. Responding to unknown stimuli, the solar wisp launches itself back into space to latch onto another comet or meteor to repeat the process.<br><br>As a solar wisp feeds and ages, it increases in density but decreases in diameter. Despite its reduction in size to a mere few feet in diameter, a mature solar wisp burns with far greater intensity and is much more dangerous than a juvenile. A solar wisp of any age and size can pose a threat, however, as it is unwavering in its pursuit of food, consuming the minerals it seeks out in its internal furnace. This can be a destructive process that puts it in conflict with other species—especially if those species also rely on the same minerals for economic stability. Most creatures that attempt to stop a mature solar wisp underestimate its abilities thanks to its small size. Its effects on local gravity and its intense heat mean that most who confront a solar wisp are lucky if they get away with only severe burns.<br><br>Though it has a life span measured in centuries—and sometimes multiple thousands of years—a solar wisp does eventually die. An elderly solar wisp is a tiny ball that burns like a nuclear explosion, and when it expires, it implodes into a gravitational singularity that affects a half-mile radius. Though this miniature black hole lasts for less than an hour, it poses a great danger to those caught in its pull. A recent report from Near Space tells of an entire nascent colony wiped out by a dying solar wisp that, until then, had served as a kind of mascot and beacon for the unfortunate settlers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photino Crystals</h2>\n<p>In their travels, solar wisps sometimes shed portions of themselves, which cool rapidly into a glittering stream of beautiful bright-orange jewels called photino crystals that are used throughout the Pact Worlds (and beyond) as naturally occurring solarian weapon crystals. A few small starship crews make a dangerous living by following wisps— at a great distance—and waiting for this molting, scooping up the resulting jewels until their cargo holds are full, and then returning to a safer location to sort them by quality. Despite the danger inherent in collecting the gems, these solarian weapon crystals are widely available, especially in the sun’s&nbsp;Burning&nbsp;Archipelago in the Pact Worlds; aboard the kasathan worldship the <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}</em>; and in Fullbright, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces}’s scorched, sun-facing hemisphere.</p>"

		"Mountain Eel": {
			"name": "Mountain Eel",
			"description": "<p>Due to some quirk of parallel evolution, these massive creatures have features resembling their waterborne kin&rsquo;s, especially their gaping maws filled with terrible teeth. On the other hand, mountain eels have large, arthropodan compound eyes, and their coloring tends to range from dark to very dark green. Mountain eels dwell on the slopes of the mountains of Castrovel, gliding quietly between the trees as they hunt for prey. The gaze of a mountain eel paralyzes most creatures, allowing the beast to run its victims down and feast on their corpses. A typical mountain eel is about 5 feet tall but 60 feet from nostrils to tail if laid out in a straight line, though it constantly squirms and contorts its body. Despite its size, a mountain eel is very light, weighing approximately 300 pounds.</p>\n<p>Mountain eels are carnivores, and they prefer their meals to be freshly dead before they tear into the flesh. However, they need to eat close to their weight in food every day, so they have been known to devour longdead creatures if enough meat remains on the bones. If a mountain eel has sated its appetite before completely consuming its prey, it simply leaves the body to rot, sometimes coming back to it the following day or leaving it for scavengers (or other mountain eels). Mountain eels get almost all of their hydration from eating, and they tend to avoid larger bodies of water, though it isn&rsquo;t uncommon to spot a mountain eel splashing through a small stream or turning its face up toward the sky during a rainstorm. Despite their massive bulk, mountain eels are surprisingly quiet in most of their movements, as they distribute their weight across the length of their bodies using their multitude of winged armlike appendages. The creatures also use these arms to push underbrush and small trees to one side as they travel, to avoid the telling sounds of snapping branches and crunching twigs. As a mountain eel closes in on its prey, however, it abandons all attempts at subtlety to gather up enough speed to crush its targets.</p>\n<p>In addition to their uncannily quiet locomotion, mountain eels only very infrequently vocalize in any way. After years of study, scientists have discovered that the creatures&rsquo; vocal chords are almost completely vestigial. After noticing dozens of small scent glands located just under their scales during their dissections, these researchers posited that mountain eels communicate with one another through smells. Xenobiologists are still unsure exactly how this ability works, but mountain eel hunters and others who live in mountain eel territory have learned that certain smells mean danger.</p>\n<p>Mountain eels give birth to live offspring, a messy process that produces a handful of nearly translucent, mucus-covered elvers that are each almost as big as a human. Though newly born mountain elvers&rsquo; size might allow them to hunt right away, their fearsome fangs don&rsquo;t grow in for several weeks. During this time, the parent eels bring small chunks of meat to their offspring, which swallow the food whole. As they start feeding, their pigmentation slowly comes in, and when they do finally develop their teeth, the elvers can take down their own, albeit smaller, prey. It takes several more years of constant eating before an elver becomes a full adult mountain eel and another few years before it reaches sexual maturity.</p>\n<p>Judging on appearance alone, it is difficult to tell an elderly mountain eel from an adult. A mountain eel close to the end of its life tends to move a little slower, however, and the odors it emanates become more flowery. Once it becomes unable to catch enough food, the beast slowly starves to death. A mountain eel&rsquo;s corpse quickly succumbs to the elements, rotting faster than most other dead flesh and attracting teeming swarms of insects. Even a dead mountain eel&rsquo;s bones seem to disappear after a few days in Castrovelian weather; they are often mistaken for fallen logs covered in a thick layer of bright-green moss.</p>\n<p>Some lashuntas and formians enjoy hunting mountain eels, despite (and many would say because of) the danger they pose. These thrill seekers equip themselves with sniper rifles and veils before setting out for the planet&rsquo;s mountainous areas. The eels leave very little trace of their movements through the foliage, so hunters must be on the lookout for partially chewed carcasses and other signs of mountain eel habitation, such as an increased insect population. Once they find one of the beasts, they make sure to isolate it before striking. Successful lashunta hunters skin the dead eels to make items of clothing, which they sometimes enchant (like the items presented below). Formians, on the other hand, enjoy cooking mountain eel meat, using an array of exotic spices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Deep in the lightless depths of countless worlds live&nbsp;murzzilats, amphibious mammals known for their grotesque&nbsp;contortions and ethereal vocalizations. Capable of both&nbsp;swimming and flight, these creatures are ungainly on land&nbsp;but well adapted to life in partially submerged tunnels and&nbsp;caverns, where their songs echo for miles in a haunting&nbsp;underground symphony.</p>\n<p>A murzzilat has an oversized head with massive bulging eyes and a wide mouth it unhinges to swallow small prey whole. Green scales lined with dozens of powerful pectoral fins covers its elongated, shriveled body. Membranous wings protrude from its back, and six spindly limbs dangle down from its body, each ending in a sharp hook. Although these weak limbs can&rsquo;t support its body weight, a murzzilat can shove them deep into cracks to drag small prey out of hiding or use them to latch onto large prey. An average murzzilat is 6 feet long and weighs 35 pounds.</p>\n<p>While swimming, murzzilats fold their wings flat against their backs and fold their legs up under their bodies, propelling themselves through the water with their fins. The incredibly flexible creatures squeeze through narrow tunnels and cracks by contorting and twisting their bodies, displaying their internal organs, and popping their limbs in and out of joint. These adaptations enable murzzilats to escape from cave-ins and travel through tiny tunnels that creatures of their size typically couldn&rsquo;t pass.</p>\n<p>Murzzilats have scent glands along their backs, which they rub along stone to mark their territory. This overwhelmingly strong scent is long lasting but pleasing to most sentient species. Highly valued in the beauty and cleaning industries, the scent glands of a murzzilat fetch a high price on the black market and&nbsp;make poaching a profitable venture, particularly on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and other planets with lax environmental regulations.</p>\n<p>Incredibly vocal, murzzilats have a multitude of calls, cries, and songs. From clicking trills and deep bellows to haunting nocturnes and joyful refrains, their many songs echo throughout the tunnels and caverns they call home, both above and below water. Considered holy to some adherents of the goddess Shelyn, murzzilat songs have inspired artists throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond.

Each mimic is a swarm of nanobots that interlock to imitate an item. When a would-be looter picks up the nanobot mimic, the construct dissolves into a dark and silvery cloud of its component nanobots. These then swarm the victim, hindering and attempting to disassemble it.<br /><br />Nanobot mimics are often quasi-legal. They see some licensed use as security. However, criminals use these constructs far more often, since they serve as fine traps for investigators. Clever scofflaws make mimics look like illegal objects to draw attention. When a detective noses into an area and finds the mimic, the creature not only attacks and makes the target more vulnerable to other attacks, but can also dispose of the body.<br /><br />The constructs have a penchant for escaping confinement, though, especially after they take significant damage, causing their programming to become faulty. When free of the control of another being, such mimics still follow their (possibly impaired) directives. Intermittently, the mimic takes the shape of various objects it sees other creatures using. It then, without real intent, attacks anyone who picks up the false object. A number of bizarre &ldquo;murders&rdquo; on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} turned out to be the doings of an escaped nanobot mimic.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or team (3-9)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"name": "Necrovite",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Long ago, when the native humanoids of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}-called elebrians-destroyed two neighboring planets, the backlash devastated their own world as well, forcing them to turn to necromancy to survive. The most powerful spellcasters among these survivors combined their advanced technology with the ancient magical traditions of lichdom to achieve immortality in the form of eternal undeath. These were the first necrovites, and along with their colleagues who sought refuge in other forms of undeath, they took control of their ravaged planet to become the first bone sages, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}&rsquo;s notoriously aloof heads of state.<br /><br />Becoming a necrovite is a long and arduous process, but the crux of the ritual involves extracting the spellcaster&rsquo;s consciousness and soul and imprisoning them in a technomagical relic called an electroencephalon. The spellcaster dies but becomes undead, and as long as her electroencephalon remains intact she can continue her existence without fear of the passage of time.<br /><br />In addition to constructing an electroencephalon to house her soul, a prospective necrovite must also research and learn the proper ritual to transfer her life force into the receptacle and prepare her body for the transformation into undeath. This ritual is unique to each body and soul-what works for one necrovite will not work for another-and likely has deleterious effects. The exact methods for each spellcaster&rsquo;s transformation into a necrovite are left to the GM&rsquo;s discretion, but the process should involve expenditures of hundreds of thousands of credits, multiple dangerous quests, and many difficult skill checks over the course of months, years, or decades.<br /><br />The above stat block represents an elebrian necrovite-a necrovite formed from one of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}&rsquo;s original humanoid inhabitants-but other races can become necrovites as well, using the template graft in the sidebar.<br /><br /><strong>Electroencephalon</strong><br />An integral step in becoming a necrovite is the creation of the electroencephalon in which the aspirant stores her consciousness and soul. The only way to truly destroy a necrovite is to locate and destroy her electroencephalon; otherwise, the necrovite simply regenerates, awakening fully healed 1d10 days later. Not even disintegrating a necrovite&rsquo;s corpse or flinging it into a sun can destroy it-so long as the electroencephalon remains unharmed. This is one reason why many necrovites not only keep their electroencephalons hidden but build secret bunkers to house them, stocked with whatever they might need to rebuild and take revenge on their killers.<br /><br />Each necrovite must craft her own unique electroencephalon, which is a hybrid item with a level equal to the character&rsquo;s caster level at the time of creation. The character must be a spellcaster and have a caster level of 7th or higher. Creating an electroencephalon otherwise follows the normal rules for crafting equipment (see page 235 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook). The cost to create an electroencephalon varies between individual creators and should be determined by the GM, but it is roughly equivalent to the price of a small arm with an item level equal to the creator&rsquo;s caster level.<br /><br /><strong>Eoxian Wrackstaves</strong><br />The Eoxian wrackstaff is a hybrid weapon that can trace its history back to the time when @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox} was a living world with living inhabitants. Used by ancient elebrian leaders to keep their subjects and slaves in line, the Eoxian wrackstaff survives to the modern day as a relic of that past still clung to by those same rulers, who turned to undeath to survive their planets&rsquo; demise. Now, most elebrian bone sages wield these weapons as symbols of their undying rule, and their use has spread throughout the Pact Worlds, though people tend not to trust a wielder of one.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"name": "Needlehawk",
			"description": "<p>Winged arthropods from an unknown world (presumably in the Vast), needlehawks are gifted with a sophisticated spinal cord and brain, making them intelligent and curious creatures that can build complex nests and even open latches. These traits, combined with their ability to fly and anesthetizing venom, make them difficult pests to eliminate once a prickle finds a steady food supply. While xenobiologists believe needlehawks are indigenous to a jungle ecosystem, the animals have been spotted across many worlds. Once established, needlehawks hunt insects, scavenge or steal food, and build their homes from whatever materials they can find-often tearing up valuable cargo or disassembling machinery in the process.<br /><br />Needlehawks reproduce asexually, but they produce larger and healthier egg broods when all three sexes contribute. Sticky egg clusters hatch into thousands of mite-sized young, which infest and devour any detritus as well as each other. Eventually, a half-dozen or so young grow large enough to climb onto their parents&rsquo; backs and learn to survive through observation. While needlehawks have no attachment to their miniscule hordes of young, they are fiercely protective of their larger, nymph-stage offspring after they grow wings.<br /><br />Needlehawks are especially sensitive to fungal @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, and dycepskians sometimes infest them to create organic drones enslaved to their alien hive mind. Infested needlehawks act as silent lookouts, spies, and guardians. As the dycepskian fungus requires a sentient mind to develop self-awareness, infested needlehawks retain animal-level cunning but react intuitively to the commands of higher-order dycepskian hosts. Conspiracy theorists speculate that dycepskians and needlehawks originate from the same world, and that the crustacean-like scavengers were the parasite&rsquo;s original host.</p>"

Shaped like a pterodactyl, a niaq is white with a network of black-blooded veins that extend across its body. Instead of eyes, the creature has a mane of cilia that sense minute variations in temperature, allowing it to distinguish heat signatures of prey and the nearby topography. For a mouth, the creature has a feeding lance, which is a tight cylinder of long, hollow quills. Each of a niaq&rsquo;s wings has a fringe of similar but shorter quills that the creature can launch as projectiles with a flick of a wing.<br /><br />The feeding lance and quills can infect prey with a virus that lives symbiotically within the niaq.

They have no known major settlements of their own, though rumors persist of technologically advanced labyrinths hidden deep within asteroids of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}. Beyond @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, they are most often found on exploratory ships, as their combination of impressive physiques, keen intellects, and urges to research and create serve them well. However, as nuars age, they also tend to want to establish roots, often returning to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} to start a family or build a community.<br /><br />A typical nuar stands between 7 and 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds.</p>\n<h2>Maze-Cores</h2>\n<p>The nuars&rsquo; natural grasp of complex patterns and shifting connections has allowed them to develop special kinds of multifunctional devices using an adjustable component known as a maze-core. A maze-core device acts as two different pieces of equipment, though it can function as only one of the two at any given time. Only powered or technological equipment can be built as maze-core devices, and the items must be melee weapons, small arms, longarms, heavy weapons, computers, or technological devices.<br /><br />To create a maze-core device, select two pieces of equipment. The maze-core device has a bulk equal to that of the bulkiest of the two items + 1, and a cost equal to the most expensive of the two items + 1-1/2 times the cost of the less expensive item. When determining the maze-core equipment&rsquo;s hardness and Hit Points, treat it as having the higher level of the two items, but for all other calculations, each item retains its own item level. If both items require the same kind of ammunition or power (such as a battery), they share a single battery of the highest capacity either device uses.<br /><br />Changing a piece of maze-core equipment to function as the alternate piece of equipment is a swift action.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

These fearless hunters eat whatever they can catch and kill.

A nyssholora has a pair of upper appendages with claws that resemble scythe blades, as well as a smaller pair of similar arms the creature uses to mark its territory and communicate its location to offspring, hunting partners, or a mate. A wide maw filled with two rows of fangs dominates the creature&rsquo;s head, and eight beady eyes run in two vertical rows along the bridge of its nose. A wide, flat crest tops its skull, behind which writhe a mass of short, smooth tentacles. A smaller bundle of tentacles tips the nyssholora&rsquo;s tail. These tentacles serve two purposes. First, the nyssholora uses them to collect energy from the atmosphere. Second, they aid the nyssholora in sensing the presence of telepathic prey, including formians and lashuntas. Stealth in the plains is all but impossible for a creature the size of a nyssholora, and it makes little effort to camouflage itself, sporting bright neon striations of yellow and orange across its thick purple or pink hide.<br /><br />Nyssholoras nest and lay eggs, and both parents keep watch over unhatched young in the treacherous Castrovelian wilderness. Brooding nyssholoras are particularly aggressive, due to hunger and the desire to protect their offspring. When young nyssholoras hatch, they remain in the nest for only a day. They then stay near a parent, learning how to hunt. Juvenile nyssholoras become more and more independent over the course of a month and then set out on their own or in small groups that typically end up breaking up a couple months later. Adult nyssholoras have been known to respond to distress calls of their own offspring up to a year after separation.<br /><br />The people of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} hunt nyssholoras to keep their numbers down. Big-game hunters collect the beasts&rsquo; phasic claws, the third segment of the creature&rsquo;s forearms. These bladed talons are sharp, but their real danger is that they vibrate at ultrasonic speeds, creating a blade of concentrated sound waves that precedes the physical structure of the claw as it swipes through the air. This can cut through even extremely dense materials. Because of these adaptations, Castrovelian scientists have long believed that nyssholoras evolved to hunt prey that had both telepathy and preternaturally strong armor. This hypothetical prey has long since vanished from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, but the nyssholora, lacking predators to challenge its position at the top of the food chain, has remained. More than one nyssholora has used its talons to carve open vehicle hulls or cut into city walls to get at prey.<br /><br />Similarly, the volume and force with which a nyssholora releases its low, resonant roar are enough to weaken the structural integrity of buildings and concuss the bodies of other creatures. This mighty bellow offers potential prey an early warning to the beast&rsquo;s approach since, in the absence of overwhelming ambient noise, a nyssholora&rsquo;s cry can be heard as far as 20 miles away.

By aligning light-deflecting microstructures on the feathery foliage that sprouts from its appendages, a stationary obfuchsia can make itself all but invisible against its surroundings.

Odheos prefer to live in artificial environments, limiting their destruction of natural ecosystems, but this preference is cold comfort to those urban and station residents they torment.<br /><br />An odheo is a bold pest, openly jabbing creatures with its long tongue and then escaping back into hiding before victims can retaliate. They live in vents or engineering tunnels and breed rapidly, making them difficult to remove once they have infested an area. They are also impossible to eat, exploding into a rancid mix of gore and slime when killed, rendering them useless for anything other than aggravation.<br /><br />Odheos evolved from an arboreal ancestor that used its long tongue to attach to creatures that passed by. The odheo&rsquo;s ten chitinous legs and gripping feet still make it extremely adept at climbing almost any surface. Unlike its ancestors, though, an odheo uses its harpoon tongue as its main method of feeding, only moving in to bite creatures that are helpless or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}.<br /><br />Odheos lair in cramped spaces, but only a few remain in their filth-covered nest at any one time, while the others hunt.

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Oma are vast creatures, often called &ldquo;space whales,&rdquo; that travel endlessly through the inky void. They magically project electromagnetic fields that shield them from the effects of the vacuum as well as from the particulate rings and dense atmospheres of the gas giants in which they usually feed, extracting energy and nutrients with their energy baleen. Oma are most often seen traveling alone, though there are regions of the Pact Worlds system where pods of oma are known to migrate together on a particular, if mysterious, schedule. Rarely, massive numbers of oma gather in the rings of a planet and put on an incredible show, their energy fields intermingling and reacting with local gases to light up swaths of space in a multicolored spectacle. A typical oma is 150 feet long and weighs 250 tons.<br /><br />The most commonly known-and least understood-feature of oma is their starsong: a haunting telepathic melody that can be perceived thousands of miles away, even across the void of space. While most describe starsong as slow, mournful, and crooning, none ever agree on the finer details of a particular oma song, which suggests that each listener hears something different. Attempts to decipher concrete meaning from these tonal poems have so far eluded even the most brilliant magic and linguistics experts, as the oma speak in riddles that even they don&rsquo;t always appear to understand. Scholars and cryptolinguists among the glowing (and completely unrelated) poet-whales of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}&rsquo;s arctic seas claim that the patterns represent a surprisingly complete oral history of the universe, albeit a highly stylized and nonchronological version. Whatever the content of the songs, even the saltiest of spacefarers can become tearily nostalgic when they recall their first experience hearing the haunting sound in the silence between worlds.<br /><br />Most reported interactions with oma have affirmed their docile nature, and many experienced spacefarers believe that the titanic creatures have a benevolent streak and that sighting one is a sign of good luck and favorable trade ahead. More than one crew of a disabled starship has reported being found by a passing oma, which then herded the ship back to civilized space. Once its temporary charges are safe again among their kind, the oma bids farewell with slow somersaults and cryptic starsong. However, those few that have attempted to hunt oma for sport have found them more than capable of defending themselves; the massive beasts can unleash a targeted burst of energy that disables most modern starship power cores. This has not gone unnoticed by various governments, who make periodic (and so far unsuccessful) attempts to reverse engineer and weaponize this ability. Oma are also capable of swallowing small starships (such as fighters and interceptors) whole; some do it accidentally as they feed, but most only when provoked.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any vacuum or gas giant</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or pod (3-5)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Part gene repository, part temple, and part environmental guardian, an oracle of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} is a sacred tree that presides in biodiverse ecosystems as a protector and cataloger of evolving species and rare genomes. Although most commonly found in dense forests and jungles, oracles of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} can be found in almost every kind of terrain and on a number of planes. As saplings, they adapt themselves to wherever they set down roots, from land to sea to far stranger environs. They flourish in places sacred to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras}: those that are biodiverse, breathtaking, and in a state of constant flux. The oracles believe that adaptation and evolution are sacred paths to meeting new challenges, and they offer guidance and protection to life forms and ecosystems that embody such change. A typical oracle of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} is 60 feet tall and 20 feet in diameter, but they can grow larger or smaller depending on their environment.<br /><br />Since they are rooted, oracles of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} welcome visitors from afar, and they send their seedlings far and wide with trusted emissaries so that their offspring can experience change, explore new horizons, and help life reshape itself. They spur growth and trade sacred genetic information, helping those that they protect change and evolve to meet new challenges. Rumors suggest that the trees are indirectly responsible for some of the most potent and beneficial mutations in recent history, such as the creation of stable bleachling gnomes. Oracles of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} do not claim individual names, but sapient creatures often given them titles of esteem based on their location, such as Oracle of Daza.<br /><br />Oracles of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} have been found floating in the clouds of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}, and other gas giants, drawing nourishment from the mists around them. On @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, several grow deep in the jungles of Ukulam, and one resides near the city of El, where it engages in discourse with scientific and spiritual scholars. Others have been found nestled among coral reefs in the oceans of Melos and Kalo-Mahoi and thriving in the radioactive fields outside Daza in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. Whatever its environ, each tree grows far from others of its species, sometimes separated by entire continents or even planets from the next nearest of its kind. The trees are gregarious, showing a great interest in biotechnicians, scholars, xenodruids, and new sapient species. Where oracles of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} grow larger than the endemic sapient life, they have formed themselves into elaborate treehouses that house their followers and honored guests. These treehouses serve as dormitories and guesthouses, constantly adapting themselves to serve the needs of their residents. In return, some inhabitants pledge themselves to the protection of the tree, serving as an unofficial security force. Other visitors are more transitory, traveling from one oracle to another via their verdant portals and sharing news and offerings of genetic information.<br /><br />Oracles of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} sometimes find themselves in conflict with sapient creatures that are particularly exploitative of their environment. Many a construction project and city expansion that would threaten a delicate ecosystem near an oracle of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} has met with mysterious catastrophe severe enough to end the endeavor. The trees also freely offer up genetic variants of both staple crops and rare or endangered animal and plant life, driving down the value of those offered by companies that would profit from patented life forms.<br /><br />On occasion, oracles have been known to offer sanctuary to rogue scientists, political prisoners, or those labeled eco-terrorists, protecting such wards at any cost. More rarely, an oracle of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras} can go rogue, valuing change and experimentation so much that it deliberately imbalances an ecosystem or tries to transform inhabitants against their will. In such cases, local governments-or even other oracles in the same network-usually seek adventurers or other third parties to resolve these disputes.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or treehouse (1 plus 1-10 followers of other species)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Offense</h2>\n<h3>Connection</h3>\n<p>xenodruid</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

These timid monk-scientists dedicate their lives to studying various fields of science, sharing their discoveries with their fellow osharus and other races that express a passion for epiphany. They dedicate their discoveries to their deity @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.rUtAoz8NUGCZR4yz]{Yaraesa}, patron of learning and science.<br /><br />Osharu settlements are essentially citysized universities. Individuals involved in similar fields of study group together so they can aid in each others&rsquo; research, and entire districts spring up naturally around these congregations of higher learning, equipped with canteens, vast libraries, living quarters, and workstations relevant to their field.<br /><br />This ultimate quest for knowledge knows no planetary bounds; osharus often embark on fieldwork expeditions to other star systems in order to study foreign planets, stars, or even the emptiness of space itself. They also frequently go on diplomatic missions to exchange knowledge with other intelligent, enlightenment-minded races.<br /><br />Thought stalwart in mind and faith, osharus are physically delicate. They are harmed not only by salt and salt water, but also have a cumbersome dependence on moisture and humid environments. Exposure to extreme heat or direct sunlight for extended amounts of time without protective magic or armor makes them extremely uncomfortable. Those who aren&rsquo;t magically inclined might even resort to soaking their clothes and carrying large canteens of water for rehydration when exploring even mildly arid biomes.<br /><br />Despite the osharus&rsquo; willingness to face great dangers, they are a timid and paranoid race. Their most common fear is that their desire to explore the galaxy and exchange knowledge with other species could ultimately result in their exploitation&mdash;or even their eradication. To cope with this paranoia, they flatly refuse to travel beyond the safety of their university-cities while alone, always accompanying at least one other osharu so they can protect and comfort one another. Osharus sometimes develop such a bond with equally sensitive members of other species, establishing a similar system of mutual support.<br /><br />The average osharu is 4 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds, though members of the species have a wide variety of colors and patterns. Even two parents with similar patterns or colors can have completely different-looking offspring&mdash;it is not unusual for a beige, leopard-spotted osharu to give birth to bright-pink or green tiger-striped progeny. This diversity is celebrated among osharu, and they find the predictability of hereditary outcomes among other humanoid species to be both unusual and fascinating&mdash;most of their university-cities have a district dedicated to the study of xenogenetics as a result.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>pair or expedition (3-6 plus 1 headteacher)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

These largely sessile filter feeders anchor themselves to rocks, coral, shipwrecks or, occasionally, the shells of larger creatures early in life, rarely if ever moving from that spot. Resembling translucent tubes, osiferns are famous for their visible and deceptively sturdy internal skeleton&mdash;a defensive counterpoint to the creatures&rsquo; soft and flexible exteriors. Opaque, varied markings give them the appearance of having faces, although they don&rsquo;t have eyes. While these patterns provide camouflage for young osiferns or spook potential predators, many adults sport bright, distinctive &ldquo;faces&rdquo; that make them stand out rather than blend in.</p>\n<p>Although outwardly endearing and harmless, osiferns are remarkably dangerous. Highly resilient, these creatures can adapt to salty, brackish, or fresh water without difficulty. Osiferns also readily bludgeon neighboring creatures to eliminate competition within their territories, and the enzymes they spray in self-defense conveniently also break down trespassers&rsquo; flesh into morsels the osiferns can absorb. Their gregarious sprouts can grow into vast osifern gardens; they can alert each other to danger through chemical signals, rallying rudimentary group defenses.</p>\n<p>Dangerous enough with their normal life cycle, osiferns infrequently congregate and then collectively metamorphose into an osifern enigma&mdash;a large, free-swimming predator with a central notochord and a mouth ringed with thick, ropy tendrils. The composite body has pneumatic mouthparts and teeth capable of grabbing and swallowing larger prey, in contrast to smaller osiferns&rsquo; filter feeding method. Most enigmas studied so far appear approximately 10 feet long and weigh 250 pounds, yet scars left on their escaped prey suggest they can reach twice this size or larger. Osifern enigmas can swiftly undulate through the water to reach deeper areas, where they commonly adapt to crushing depths and frigid temperatures (though enigmas that live near volcanic vents often have resistance to fire instead of cold).</p>\n<p>Enigmas demonstrate a surprising degree of aesthetic sensibilities, as they seem to enjoy making visual statements with their bodily markings, expelling jets of bioluminescence without warning and&nbsp;even grafting sparkly rocks or the bones of their prey onto their diaphanous bodies to augment their appearances.</p>\n<p>Scientific expeditions regularly hire adventurous divers and submersible pilots to help study (or even capture) enigmas, whereas conservation programs just as often send contractors with the same skills to eliminate osifern infestations.</p>\n<h3>Deep Indigo Extract</h3>\n<p>Scientists who survived early encounters with enigmas took samples of the sparkling, rainbow-hued organic matter&mdash;nicknamed deep indigo&mdash; that threatened osiferns expel. This material has inspired numerous medical developments, especially ones that harness osiferns&rsquo; regenerative properties. While osifern sprouts contain the same chemicals needed to produce these medicinal extracts, they yield such small quantities that harvesting enough to create even a single dose has proven inefficient, though not impossible. Deep indigo extract follows the rules for medicinals presented on pages 231&ndash;232 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook; two examples are described below.</p>\n<h4>Cytoguard</h4>\n<p>Similar to an antitoxin, cytoguard actively regenerates cellular damage, mitigating the immediate effects of poison. When you take or are injected with cytoguard, you gain resistance equal to 3 times the medicinal&rsquo;s tier to the damage dealt by initial exposure to poison. In addition, you gain a bonus equal to the medicinal&rsquo;s tier to saving throws against poison. Both effects last for a number of hours equal to the medicinal&rsquo;s tier.</p>\n<h4>Prismatilate</h4>\n<p>A prismatilate extract releases a steady dose of endorphins and regenerative agents that encourage long-term recovery. When you take or are injected with prismatilate, you gain a bonus (equal to 2 + the medicinal&rsquo;s tier) to saving throws to remove negative levels. In addition, you increase the number of HP you recover from a full night&rsquo;s rest or complete bed rest by 25% times the medicinal&rsquo;s tier.

These largely sessile filter feeders anchor themselves to rocks, coral, shipwrecks or, occasionally, the shells of larger creatures early in life, rarely if ever moving from that spot. Resembling translucent tubes, osiferns are famous for their visible and deceptively sturdy internal skeleton&mdash;a defensive counterpoint to the creatures&rsquo; soft and flexible exteriors. Opaque, varied markings give them the appearance of having faces, although they don&rsquo;t have eyes. While these patterns provide camouflage for young osiferns or spook potential predators, many adults sport bright, distinctive &ldquo;faces&rdquo; that make them stand out rather than blend in.</p>\n<p>Although outwardly endearing and harmless, osiferns are remarkably dangerous. Highly resilient, these creatures can adapt to salty, brackish, or fresh water without difficulty. Osiferns also readily bludgeon neighboring creatures to eliminate competition within their territories, and the enzymes they spray in self-defense conveniently also break down trespassers&rsquo; flesh into morsels the osiferns can absorb. Their gregarious sprouts can grow into vast osifern gardens; they can alert each other to danger through chemical signals, rallying rudimentary group defenses.</p>\n<p>Dangerous enough with their normal life cycle, osiferns infrequently congregate and then collectively metamorphose into an osifern enigma&mdash;a large, free-swimming predator with a central notochord and a mouth ringed with thick, ropy tendrils. The composite body has pneumatic mouthparts and teeth capable of grabbing and swallowing larger prey, in contrast to smaller osiferns&rsquo; filter feeding method. Most enigmas studied so far appear approximately 10 feet long and weigh 250 pounds, yet scars left on their escaped prey suggest they can reach twice this size or larger. Osifern enigmas can swiftly undulate through the water to reach deeper areas, where they commonly adapt to crushing depths and frigid temperatures (though enigmas that live near volcanic vents often have resistance to fire instead of cold).</p>\n<p>Enigmas demonstrate a surprising degree of aesthetic sensibilities, as they seem to enjoy making visual statements with their bodily markings, expelling jets of bioluminescence without warning and&nbsp;even grafting sparkly rocks or the bones of their prey onto their diaphanous bodies to augment their appearances.</p>\n<p>Scientific expeditions regularly hire adventurous divers and submersible pilots to help study (or even capture) enigmas, whereas conservation programs just as often send contractors with the same skills to eliminate osifern infestations.</p>\n<h3>Deep Indigo Extract</h3>\n<p>Scientists who survived early encounters with enigmas took samples of the sparkling, rainbow-hued organic matter&mdash;nicknamed deep indigo&mdash; that threatened osiferns expel. This material has inspired numerous medical developments, especially ones that harness osiferns&rsquo; regenerative properties. While osifern sprouts contain the same chemicals needed to produce these medicinal extracts, they yield such small quantities that harvesting enough to create even a single dose has proven inefficient, though not impossible. Deep indigo extract follows the rules for medicinals presented on pages 231&ndash;232 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook; two examples are described below.</p>\n<h4>Cytoguard</h4>\n<p>Similar to an antitoxin, cytoguard actively regenerates cellular damage, mitigating the immediate effects of poison. When you take or are injected with cytoguard, you gain resistance equal to 3 times the medicinal&rsquo;s tier to the damage dealt by initial exposure to poison. In addition, you gain a bonus equal to the medicinal&rsquo;s tier to saving throws against poison. Both effects last for a number of hours equal to the medicinal&rsquo;s tier.</p>\n<h4>Prismatilate</h4>\n<p>A prismatilate extract releases a steady dose of endorphins and regenerative agents that encourage long-term recovery. When you take or are injected with prismatilate, you gain a bonus (equal to 2 + the medicinal&rsquo;s tier) to saving throws to remove negative levels. In addition, you increase the number of HP you recover from a full night&rsquo;s rest or complete bed rest by 25% times the medicinal&rsquo;s tier. Both effects last for 24 hours.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>aquatic (any water)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or accumulation (3&ndash;13)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

A typical plasma ooze is a rough hemisphere approximately 20 feet in diameter, weighing close to 100 tons.<br /><br />The origin of these oozes has been hotly debated since before the Gap, with ancient scholars speculating that the creatures originated on the Plane of Fire and were drawn to an inhabited system&rsquo;s sun. However, nearly a century ago, the discovery of deserted cities within the sun of the Pact Worlds-along with modern claims by Plane of Fire natives that yet more civilizations exist in deeper layers of the sun-spawned a host of new theories, as abundant as the oozes are rare.<br /><br />One of the most popular hypotheses is that the sun&rsquo;s abandoned cities, now called the&nbsp;Burning&nbsp;Archipelago, were the site of an ancient civilization&rsquo;s attempts to harness the power of the star. As proponents of this story would have it, the experimenters were successful in creating the first plasma oozes, but they soon lost control of their creations and were quickly eradicated by the beings. Supposedly, the unleashed plasma oozes not only shut down the technological defenses of their creators, but also wiped out the digitally stored collective knowledge upon which the civilization relied for its continued survival. This version of events, though based almost entirely on conjecture and unable to explain plasma oozes&rsquo; presence in other systems, is nonetheless often cited by those who caution against an overdependence on technology.<br /><br />Such theories are met with vehement opposition by Sarenites, many of whom believe the Dawnflower herself created the sun&rsquo;s cities and would not have permitted such a fate to befall them. Some of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VJ0UTIsAggcCQJBu]{Sarenrae}&rsquo;s worshipers believe that the goddess created the plasma oozes too, making them custodians of the Archipelago and solar sites in other systems, and that whatever emptied the sun&rsquo;s cities did so despite the oozes&rsquo; protection.<br /><br />Plasma ooze sightings often occur at the perimeter of a star just before massive flares occur, leading many to believe that the two are connected somehow. Some of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VJ0UTIsAggcCQJBu]{Sarenrae}&rsquo;s worshipers claim that the oozes themselves draw out such flares in a search for some artifact buried deep with the sun, while more recent evidence points to the flares being involved in their reproduction.<br /><br />Several centuries ago, shortly after Drift travel became widespread, a small residential starship on a routine trip through the Drift reported encountering an enormous plasma ooze, many times larger than those of the Pact Worlds&rsquo; sun. Since then, a sighting is made every few decades on average, with the ooze&rsquo;s reported size gradually increasing each time. How the plasma ooze entered the Drift in the first place is an open question; while most agree that the ooze must have been ripped from the Material Plane by the activation of a Drift engine, some suspect a deeper connection between the ooze and the Drift, normally accessible only by technology granted by the ascended AI god @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}. A few scholars even posit that the creature&rsquo;s distortion of electromagnetic fields somehow granted it access to the Drift. Plasma oozes&rsquo; strong electromagnetic field makes them extremely dangerous to encounter in the vacuum of space, since even shielded starships can find themselves adrift after crossing paths with one. Similarly, in the rare instances when a plasma ooze takes up residence on a populated planet&rsquo;s surface, the edges of its territory are often marked by the dusty hulls of disabled vehicles, their former owners having wisely abandoned them to live another day. Few living creatures survive contact with a plasma ooze, but those that do often bear terrible wounds that serve as permanent reminders of such oozes&rsquo; fearsome power.<br /><br />A small group of planar scions whose ancestry connects them to the Plane of Fire, and who have served in various military forces, has recently claimed to be actively hunting plasma oozes under the moniker &ldquo;the Sunkillers.&rdquo; They have stockpiled electricity-resistant armor and defensive gear to complement their natural tolerance for fire, and they are currently amassing powerful sonic weaponry that they are confident will bypass the creatures&rsquo; formidable defenses. Even with their preparations and experience, they are taking a considerable risk for what seems to be little reward-though anyone who could reliably take on a plasma ooze could likely charge a hefty fee for the service.</p>"

		"Plasmalisk": {
			"name": "Plasmalisk",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Powerful reptilian predators, plasmalisks rely on blasts of plasma to hunt, scorching their prey and feasting on the remains. The key to their power stems from their ion cores&mdash; this specialized organ combines depressurization, chemical catalysts, and tiny nuclear reactions to ionize metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium. Plasmalisks use their constant plasma furnace as both a weapon and a power source. Not only do wisps of the plasma escape when plasmalisks bite, but they can also expel gouts of the ionized gases or channel the energy into creatures that meet their gazes. Their prey often boil alive, yet stronger victims smolder for hours, attracting scavengers before exploding and littering the area with ample food for canny plasmalisks to consume.</p>\n<p>Plasmalisks typically measure 12 feet from snout to tail and weigh about 4,500 pounds. These ponderous creatures rarely move at any pace faster than an amble even with their eight legs; this sluggishness stems from their alien metabolisms. Rather than draw power from mitochondria, plasmalisks&rsquo; cells are fueled almost entirely by a constant field of energy from their ion cores. When not actively hunting, their reaction rates slow. Plasmalisks often enter a torpor state in which they maintain just enough of their metabolism to restart the reactions once necessary. Their scales radiate a portion of their energy, both illuminating their surroundings and creating an electroreception field through which plasmalisks can sense nearby creatures and objects. Hibernating plasmalisks create almost no light, whereas fully active ones practically incandesce. Adults can modulate their light&rsquo;s color and pattern to communicate, making nighttime mating displays visible for miles. In rare cases, whole mosaics gather together to glow in a reflection of the sky&rsquo;s colors, attracting daring explorers and tourists who chase meteorological events in the hopes of spotting this behavior.</p>\n<p>Due to these resource-intensive actions, plasmalisks display ectothermic habits, sunning themselves or even basking on exposed cliffs during lightning storms or auroras to absorb ionized particles. These events generally calm plasmalisks, even to the point that they tolerate visitors and onlookers. Yet should plasmalisks absorb too much energy, they become moody and agitated, recklessly cavorting or hunting in an attempt to burn off the high. Reactors, power stations, and forges often draw the creatures from miles around, ultimately leading to the destruction of such locations once the plasmalisks overindulge and rampage.</p>\n<p>After a successful hunt, a plasmalisk primarily feeds on the ionized particles of its victims. However, the creature also requires conventional nutrients, albeit in smaller quantities than expected for sustaining its size; typically,&nbsp; a plasmalisk procures such nourishment by consuming its prey&rsquo;s still-smoldering bodies. A plasmalisk&rsquo;s greatest drive is its need for key minerals. Inexpertly dug furrows attest to a plasmalisk&rsquo;s foraging, and it can migrate as much as 200 miles to reach mineral sources&mdash;no matter who or what lies in the way.</p>\n<p>Plasmalisks usually lay just a pair of eggs, depositing the second one roughly a week after the first, but well-fed females occasionally lay larger, even-numbered clutches. The translucent eggs glow with their parents&rsquo; ionizing energy, periodically fluctuating as the developing embryos shift and dream. Half of the eggs always hatch early, and these first hatchlings quickly cannibalize one of their less-developed clutch mates. Although macabre, this practice is essential to young plasmalisks&rsquo; survival, as hatchlings lack both the nutrients and activation energy to properly develop their ion cores. Genetic studies show that the slain sibling isn&rsquo;t fully digested; the survivor&rsquo;s body directly incorporates portions of the sibling&rsquo;s organs and DNA, creating a chimeric whole. Collectors delight in capturing plasmalisk eggs&mdash;no easy feat given the parents&rsquo; tireless nest patrols. A little jury-rigged hardware can transform a healthy egg into a mobile (yet quite unethical) power station capable of restoring up to 100 charges or even&nbsp;jump-starting a damaged starship before killing the creature.</p>\n<h3>PLASMA PAINT</h3>\n<p>Plasmalisk scales and eggshells retain their energy-dissipating&nbsp;properties. Grinding down these parts and combining them with specially formulated chemicals creates a protective paint for coating armor or shock-sensitive electronics. Plasma paint doesn&rsquo;t need to coat the entire surface of the armor it&rsquo;s being applied to, and plasma paint enthusiasts, such as celebrity performers, often commission protective suits painted with stunningly decorative designs.</p>\n<p>Your armor&rsquo;s painted patterns channel incoming energy, either dissipating it entirely or directing it into your weapons. You gain electricity resistance 5. When you take 5 or more electricity damage from a single attack or effect (before applying your resistance), you glow in a 10-foot radius (increasing the light level by one step, up to normal light) until the end of your next turn. During this time, any electricity damage you deal with non-analog weapons before the end of your next turn increases by 1d6.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any warm or temperate land</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or mosaic (3&ndash;12)</p>\n</section>"

Even when independent, gels tend to shadow their parent plasms until lured away by tempting new stimuli. Gels of all sizes periodically seek each other out, forming concerts of a dozen or more gels that sing to each other for days on end. The purpose of these gatherings remains unknown.

Some Shelynites consider the oozes sacred, believing the creatures&rsquo; songs encode messages from the Eternal Rose herself. Worshippers have compiled years-long recordings and distributed them across Pact Worlds infospheres for free, and while the acolytes try to decode these soundscapes to understand their goddess, digital music artists have shamelessly sampled the files in hundreds of songs.

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>While sapient creatures throughout the galaxy consider most oozes to simply be disgusting monstrosities, the tiny proog is relatively harmless-at its worst a minor pest, and at times a pleasant companion or pet. According to records (or more precisely, the lack of records) proogs were first discovered, or possibly created, during the Gap. Today, they are known mostly as novelty companions, due to their diminutive size, gentle attitude, and ability to transform into small objects. Proogs can mimic objects with exact precision even though they have no eyes or other visual sensors, although scientists are still uncertain on how the oozes do so. Some believe proogs have psychic abilities, but others insist proogs are able to quickly analyze objects on a molecular level before adopting the new shape.<br /><br />Regardless of the facts of a proog&rsquo;s biology, retailers are happy to sell them as pets, and a proog is perfectly content to be toted around in a small bag and fed the occasional table scrap. Proog companions are surprisingly affectionate toward their masters and are easy to train, able to perform simple transformation tricks during which they adopt the shape of various small objects as instructed by their owners. Proogs are especially popular with small children, who delight in sliding the oozes through their fingers and watching them change colors. The only downside of keeping a proog companion is the nuisance that comes with trying to find a proog after it has misbehaved. Those shopping for a proog pet should be wary, however, as unscrupulous retailers have been caught selling imitation proogs, which the merchant insists are merely sleeping or lethargic but then are later discovered to be molded gelatin in the shape of a common household object.<br /><br />As is often the case with small designer pets, many proogs have escaped their owners over the years only to reproduce in the wild. Untamed proogs can be found in a variety of environments, and though they are relatively harmless, they sometimes lash out in fear. A wild proog will transform into a small object, such as a coffee mug, and hide in plain sight. There it will remain for hours at a time, only moving to feed off discarded garbage when it is alone and unobserved. However, a proog&rsquo;s ability to mimic is not perfect, and their telltale sheen sometimes gives them away. Wild proogs are often discovered when they are accidentally dropped and, instead of shattering, the injured ooze scurries away to hide.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or swarm (150-350)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

It&rsquo;s probable that the enigmatic First Ones created both. However, anacites were designed to harvest resources and have proliferated from that origin, while protocites were designed as experiments in form and function. Several models have the ability to iterate upon their own forms, while others serve specialized roles. Despite different origins and purposes, similar types of protocites and anacites have developed in parallel, while others are distinct.<br /><br />Protocite reclaimers form one such unique model line. These scorpion-like constructs serve as the backbone of their home&rsquo;s ceaseless creativity. Noma&rsquo;s AI can conceive of endless possibilities for creatures and contraptions, and the surrounding star provides the energy for its experiments. The material resource required for this is polyfluid, a UPB-like liquid that can form any number of molecule chains, allowing the creation of any substance. Reclaimers provide a vital service as mobile recycling centers, capable of scaling any structure in Noma and gradually devouring it. They turn what they consume back into polyfluid via a complex internal system of enzymatic machinery and filters. Reclaimers then use their extruders to deposit the polyfluid in receptacles so the material can be reused.<br /><br />Most of the time, reclaimers keep busy recycling materials from Noma&rsquo;s completed experiments. However, they also serve as a frontline immune system, attacking and recycling protocites that operate outside acceptable parameters.

Most speakers exist in a state of quiet determination, moving to and fro in an approximation of a sapient creature&rsquo;s daily life. Speakers also interact with one another, and sometimes with other protocites, as a way of testing and evaluating various social simulations. Noma has created countless communities of speakers, in which the constituents conform to principles such as &ldquo;value the greater good&rdquo; or &ldquo;shun those with different limb configurations.&rdquo;<br /><br />Usually, after a speaker performs its assigned tasks, it powers down. A reclaimer then comes and grinds the speaker back into polyfluid. However, in every generation of speakers, several individuals are constructed with expanded data drives, insatiable curiosity, and no predetermined tasks to allow more autonomy than most. These &ldquo;observer&rdquo; speakers roam, watch, and guide other experiments. When they have reached the end of their life cycle, typically after several decades, such speakers seek Noma&rsquo;s Core. Within this ancient nexus, these speakers are torn limb from limb, relinquishing data drives full of their accumulated experiences.<br /><br />A protocite speaker has humanoid features.

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>While most dragons hoard treasure and others consolidate power, this smaller species of dragon values a different sort of asset: information. The psydrake has a particular fondness for conspiracy theories and sets itself up as an information broker in order to learn as much new knowledge as possible before finding a new area to prowl. A psydrake makes a nest in one place long enough to make contacts, investigate leads, and collect rumors, but they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable in one location for long. Even when a psydrake stays put, they are difficult to locate, as only their most trusted contacts know where to find them. The few bits of physical evidence a psydrake keeps of their theories tend to be cryptic; they make enough sense to help the psydrake follow clues in case their memories are somehow tampered with, but they&rsquo;re nearly impossible for anyone else to interpret, meaning no one can learn of a psydrake&rsquo;s theories without speaking to them.<br /><br />A psydrake is more than happy to spread the seeds of their conspiracy theories to anyone who will listen, but they charge a high price for full details or any kind of proof. They can be convinced to trade a story for a story-the more outlandish and unusual, the better. After a lifetime of investigating wild claims, however, a psydrake can root out true theories of conspiracy from stories fabricated to falsify a trade, and the dragon does not take kindly to being tricked. Even once a bargain is struck, they must hear a story before telling one of their own, and they tend to leave out major details of whatever they share so as not to reveal all their secrets. The best way to rid yourself of a psydrake demanding information is to trick it into trading theories with another psydrake so it ends up swapping stories back and forth endlessly with the other.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The field of quantum mechanics attempts to describe the interactions between subatomic particles. By analyzing the angular momentum and energy stored within subatomic particles, scientists hope to be able to better understand the fundamentals of the universe, but these studies are often complicated by the unusual nature of many of such particles. Researchers who experiment too recklessly with quantum forces run the risk of spontaneously creating a quantum slime, an incredibly dangerous ooze composed of enlarged subatomic particles floating inside a mass of cloudy protoplasm-like goo. Though mindless, a quantum slime has the ability to alter reality at a quantum level, calling forth storms of cosmic energy, teleporting itself and others, or diminishing a creature’s overall competency. A quantum slime floats from place to place in a rough disc shape, occasionally extending a 10-foot-long tendril wreathed in plasma energy to strike at foes.<br><br>When a quantum slime is created, usually by accident inside a laboratory or other research facility, it immediately lashes out against all other creatures present with a single-minded fury. Once it has destroyed everyone around it, the quantum slime begins exploring in response to some unknown stimulus. A quantum slime seems to move at random, occasionally teleporting past obstacles and then crossing back over its own path and attacking anything that stands in its way. Some scientists posit that quantum slimes move in response to changes in the environment on a subatomic level. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to replicate the conditions that create a quantum slime and even harder to capture and study one. A few researchers have had some luck directing a loose quantum slime’s movement by generating low-level electrical charges near the slime; too much charge, though, causes the slime to attack the source of the energy.<br><br>A quantum slime can create a quantum-entangled copy of itself, an ability that both fascinates scientists and makes the creature extraordinarily difficult to battle and contain. This allows the slime to be in two places at once, though both versions are connected to one another-when one takes damage, the wounds appear on both. As a defense tactic, the quantum slime can cause one of its copies to disappear instead of taking damage. This raises many questions about which quantum slime was the original version and which was the duplicate-a metaphysical conundrum that most quantum physicists answer with a shrug and a platitude about the “mysteries of the subatomic universe.”<br><br>Thus far, modern science has encountered only quantum slimes that were created accidentally and artificially within laboratory settings; no one has ever observed a naturally occurring quantum slimes. As a result, no concrete details about the quantum slime’s ecological niche, life cycle, reproduction, diet, and behavior are known.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Quyus originated deep in the isolated regions of space and initially encountered other life-forms when a broken fraction of their barren asteroid home joined @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}. Living for eons floating only among themselves in empty space, quyus do not require food, drink, or even an atmosphere to survive. The dangerously clever creatures quietly observed the sapient life-forms of their new homes and noted their bizarre tendency to defenselessly approach anything small, pathetic, and cute. The aberrations devised a devious hunting strategy that exploited what they saw as a flaw in the nature of many social species. Devoid of sympathy or compassion, quyus do not entirely understand why social life-forms approach them in their adorable disguises, but they receive a deep sense of satisfaction from the betrayed expressions of their victims when their adorable facades unfurl into their grotesque forms.</p>\n<p>Quyus are sightless and curious, and express their interest in the composition of other beings by dissecting their prey. They are masters of their own physiology and have learned to compress their larger, aberrant bodies into smaller forms, adopting traits such as fur and large ears to mimic what they&rsquo;ve identified as commonly cute in other creatures. Even when in their aberration forms, evidence of their facade forms can manifest in patches across their bodies, which fold together to create their disguises. Lacking visual organs in their aberrant forms, quyus capture and dissect creatures from the local environment that sapient life-forms find adorable to learn what makes them appear so precious to other species. A sudden rise in small, cute creatures disappearing or being found dismembered is often the first sign of a quyu&rsquo;s presence in the area.</p>\n<p>A quyu&rsquo;s facade form varies depending on the surrounding area, as it adapts to best fit what is considered cute by the local culture. Generally this form is round and fluffy, with large, dark eyes and a perpetually dejected expression. Quyus always aim to invent the most precious facades possible from the perspective of their victims, regardless of whether such a creature suits the local ecology. Fortunately for quyus, few potential victims pause to consider whether a particularly adorable animal is in any way adapted to its environment.</p>\n<p>Most quyus live on the edge of civilization and lure isolated individuals into secluded ambush locations with their facade forms. Many learn to imitate injuries or crying to elicit helpful responses. They sometimes stow away on starships and quietly lure individual crew members to their doom, sometimes taking out an entire crew before being discovered. Planet-bound quyus, on the other hand, might build a den and string up dissected bodies to display their collection. The cleverest and most insidious quyus hunt in cosmopolitan settings that already host a wide variety of species, sapient and otherwise.</p>\n<p>Once a quyu has lured its prey close and lulled it into a false sense of security with its pitiful visage, its beguiling eyes tear apart from the pupil, the patches of fur split apart, and its downy ears morph into protruding spikes. An eyeless head bursts from each eye, covered in an acidic slime that coats the thin gray membrane of its true skin. As its body unfurls, the skeleton pops and snaps nauseatingly into place. Its true form has long forward limbs with opposable hands and dexterous long fingers, and it perches on crouched, short back legs. Its two elongated, large-jawed heads share a single consciousness.</p>\n<p>The most experienced and intelligent quyus choose to live benignly as innocuous pets in urban environments where they accept their keepers as accessories to their disguises and slip away to prowl the city when not observed. They prefer vulnerable keepers, innocent-seeming keepers who often escape the attention of those investigating suspicious disappearances. Cases of murders and missing persons perpetrated by quyus are often difficult to prove or recognize. While the scenes often look like an animal attack, the bodies are never eaten, and the precision of the kills often hints at some level of intelligent motive. Few are familiar enough with these otherworldly aberrations to suspect one may be trotting past the murder scene as a child&rsquo;s cute and spunky pet. It typically takes a specialist or a team of experts to identify a quyu&rsquo;s work and locate it among the beloved pets in the city.</p>\n<h3>QUYU EYES</h3>\n<p>A quyu&rsquo;s eyes in its facade form are the most unique part of its hunting tactics, exhibiting hypnotic capabilities that emotionally hijack the brain. Before revealing itself, a quyu tries to enchant its prey to reduce the likelihood that they will be able to fight back. When the quyu shifts, these eyes appear to rip open, but the organ can still be found inside the true form&rsquo;s head. Even when the quyu is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}, these organs maintain their magical emotional affects and can cause fascination. When implanted into a sighted being&rsquo;s head, they are able to transfer visual information to the brain, but primarily maintain their function as hypnotic organs.</p>\n<p>A quyu&rsquo;s &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; maintain their captivating effects after the creature&rsquo;s death, and can be implanted to replace any of your current eyes. As a quyu&rsquo;s eyes are not visual organs, you must retain at least one of your original eyes to maintain your normal vision; otherwise you gain the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} condition for as long as you have this augmentation installed. An implanted quyu eye is visibly unique from any of your other eyes.</p>\n<p>When you attempt a Bluff or Diplomacy check against a target for the first time each day, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to the attempt. Alternatively, once per day, you can take a standard action to activate the eye&rsquo;s mesmerizing qualities and attempt to fascinate one target. The target must succeed a Will save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) to avoid becoming fascinated; regardless of whether the target succeeds, it is immune to the effects of all quyu eyes for 24 hours.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The combustion that occurs within a star is one of the most powerful and vital forces in nature. Through its light and heat, a sun provides energy for life on worlds millions of miles away, and organisms that do not in some way rely on these gifts are rare indeed. It seems only natural, then, that such a crucial process should have associated fey. Ravais resemble humanoid grasshoppers with gnarled, plantlike elements-every surface glowing a mottled red and yellow like the surface of the sun seen through a dark filter. Despite their constant glow, ravais aren’t made of light, at least not as most scientists understand it. Instead, ravais generate strong magnetic fields that condense light into something akin to ordinary matter. This condensed light forms a ravai’s physical body and allows it to withstand the internal heat and pressure of even the most massive stars. An average ravai is 5 feet tall and weighs just 85 pounds. Although they are occasionally mistaken for elementals, ravais have no ties to the Plane of Fire, instead dwelling in mysterious settlements inside the stars of the Material Plane.<br><br>As the fey embodiment of a star, a ravai can unleash tremendous destruction with the flaming tendrils that peel off its body like coronal mass ejections. But a ravai’s abilities also reflect the nurturing power of solar energy. The same flares of magical energy that might @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Burn} an enemy to cinders can also nourish and invigorate plants and other organisms that rely on the sun for energy. Indeed, without resorting to its magical abilities, a ravai can cause nearby plants to bloom and flourish quickly, even in the harshest conditions. First World lore speaks of ancient Material Plane societies that once summoned and bound ravais for terraforming purposes, harnessing and amplifying fey magic with lost technologies. With the advent of Drift travel, some explorers have ventured deeper into the galaxy in search of these ravai-terraformed worlds, but to date, no discoveries have been reported. However, it is said ravais hunt down any who seek to replicate these mislaid methods.<br><br>Ravais make their homes inside stars throughout the galaxy, using the immense energies found there to link their Material Plane abodes to similar regions on the First World. However, ravais have a strained relationship with the fey of the First World. Ravai religion holds that their true patron is Apholine the Flame, an v who long ago retreated to live within a sun. Ravais believe that they should follow her model and that she might return to lead them once they fully understand the mystery that led her to withdraw from First World affairs. Until then, they wait, study, and oppose the shadowy fey creatures called ankou, believing the assassin fey to be tainted, umbral reflections of ravai glory, as well as the future architects of a prophesied apocalypse called the Eclipse.<br><br>To a ravai, all creatures born in the light of the ravai’s star are that fey’s metaphorical children. Academically minded ravais take an intense interest in the organisms that arise in their Material Plane solar systems. Through magical scrying and the interception of broadcasts, such ravais carefully study the intelligent species of their chosen system, which ravais dub their wards. A ravai scholar learns its wards’ religious practices, magic systems, and popular culture. This knowledge can foster great affection toward members of ward species, but just as often, a ravai observes with scholarly detachment or the excruciating paternalism one might show for a clever but poorly trained pet.<br><br>Most ravais stay close to their homes inside stars unless called forth due to great need, summoning magic, or the orders of an v, whom ravais still begrudgingly revere. There exists, however, a particular caste, faction, or life phase of ravais that is much more likely to be encountered among Material Plane residents. Little is known in specific about these wanderers who leave their solar homes to travel the galaxy. They frequently gather members of other intelligent species, as well as numerous plant creatures, to establish sun cults, study aspects of their wards’ cultures, or pursue strange quests. Such wandering ravais are invariably tight mandibled about their motivations, but a recent Starfinder Society report indicates that several different wandering ravais have referred to the act of leaving their home stars as the Tearing, hinting that their missions among Material Plane cultures are at the direction of an interstellar ruling council of ravais called the Prominences.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any solar</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or cluster (3-9)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

The reklan usually keeps these tails rolled up, but in combat, it lashes out with them, flicking detachable spines like darts. A reklan also has two sets of smaller front tentacles linked by webs of skin, which it flaps like wings. These tentacles attach just behind the reklan’s fanged mouth.

According to such reports, these monstrosities are giant metallic spheres traveling in normal space at speeds so fast they preclude engagement. The massive spheres are said to have the ability to sunder asteroids and crack planets, sprouting razor-edged lashes that whirl around them in a lethal flurry. Enough sightings have occurred that authorities are concerned.<br><br>The creature’s name, rendalairn, derives from a monster from an old spacefaring tale, but others refer to these creatures as “planet slayers.” There are two accounts of a rendalairn landing on a planet and starting a rampage that ended only when the construct was done destroying everything it could find, including sapient life. The two targeted worlds, Brimippé III and Grixis VI, are home to the ruins of two different technologically advanced but extinct species. Some speculate that rendalairns choose technological societies and sites, which has some people worried at the possibility of such a creature reaching the Pact Worlds or Veskarium.<br><br>From observations gathered thus far, rendalairns seem to be specific in their attacks and ignore anything that doesn’t interfere with their intended devastation. During the attack on Brimippé III, scavengers recorded the rendalairn’s activity and broadcasts from orbit. In addition to a polite message informing them to maintain a safe distance from the demolition site, which each scavenger heard in their native language, the rendalairn transmitted streams of music, advertisements, or other such random media. Some of this media has since proven to be from pre-extinction Brimippé III. On Grixis VI, only some explorers escaped the rendalairn, which broadcasted its warning and then carried out the intended “demolition” with no concern for bystanders.<br><br>No report has yet indicated more than one rendalairn in any one place. They are thought to be solitary. A few scientists have asserted, given the evidence, that “the” rendalairn is unique. Disparities in description, such as coloration or composition, could be attributed to observational errors. Whatever the case, a rendalairn is spherical with a 30-foot diameter. When its lashes extend, the creature can reach up to 60 feet away. From this data, xenobiologists and engineers have speculated the creature weighs at least 50 tons.<br><br>No one is entirely sure when these massive constructs, if more than one exists, first appeared or who created them. The sheer size and complexity of the creatures indicate that significant resources and expertise were invested in their creation. According to reports, a rendalairn has no logos or other identifying marks, besides luminous circular markings that change over time. They have been sighted only in the Vast, which means they come from some far-flung part of the galaxy or, some have conjectured, beyond. The hypothesis that rendalairns are akin to tripods and, perhaps, manufactured by the same species is generally believed to be unlikely, due to the observed broadcasts, but has not been disproved. The mystery surrounding these creatures has prompted explorers and journalists to launch expeditions into the Vast in search of the monstrosities. Most return without significant data.

They range across broad swaths of the continents of Asana and Ukulam on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and due to their size and place near the top of the food chain, they are often solitary and aggressively territorial.

Like others of its kind, a whiskered renkroda has a four-chambered heart and a throat that can expand up to twice its normal diameter, allowing the creature to gulp air quickly and circulate blood effectively while in pursuit of prey. A typical hunting whiskered renkroda uses trees for cover as it stalks its victims or waits for a target to approach and then makes a sudden charge to snag its victim or knock it down. Because many of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}’s herbivores boast deadly defenses, the smaller renkrodas are fairly discerning when selecting prey. Some whiskered renkrodas can be initially timid around unfamiliar humanoids, not knowing whether they are too dangerous or more trouble than they’re worth. The hungrier the animals grow, though, the more likely they are to attack, especially during lean times when other prey is limited.<br/><br/>Unlike young males of many other species of renkrodas, whiskered adolescent males sometimes form small gangs for mutual protection against mature adults and even larger predators. They wander widely across forested territory, moving to another location when food grows scarce. As an alpha member of the gang emerges, the rest of the group typically scatters, ceding that territory to the dominant male. In order to broadcast its superiority, this triumphant renkroda often engages in reckless attacks throughout its new home and destroys its surroundings, frequently roaring, scratching at nearby trees and rocks, and marking with its scent to claim its territory.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>temperate or warm forests (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or gang (2-5)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

Once the grays incorporated brains into the protoplasm, they realized that the altered oozes took on the personality and memories of the “donors.\" Grays then began to use these oozes as quick, albeit messy, ways to replace subjects who accidentally perished from too-rigorous experimentation.<br><br>A replicant ooze requires a fresh brain (or similar organ) to be able to believably impersonate a victim, usually requiring the ooze to consume the corpse within minutes after it has died.

			"description": "<p>Security robots come in a wide variety of makes and models, with a near-endless variety of customizations based on both the manufacturer and the aesthetics and needs of the consumer. Crafted with advanced user interfaces mimicking moderate intelligence, but without any of the emotions, unpredictability, or bias of a true AI or sentient creature, security bots are an eminently practical, reasonable solution to a wide variety of security needs. Unlike full-on military models, security robots usually come preprogrammed with certain fail-safes preventing them from engaging in violence beyond what’s necessary for the protection of their assigned population or property, making them a go-to option for police forces, corporations, and even wealthy individuals looking for peace of mind.<br><br>One of the cheapest and most common types of security robot is the observer. Observer-class bots are usually small, flying robots designed primarily to record and report specific unsavory activities for later review by their owners, though they are also equipped to fend off minor threats. Whether buzzing through the access ducts of secure facilities or hovering over crowded marketplaces, observers are nearly ubiquitous in some advanced settlements. On @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, the most prominent brand is AbadarCorp’s VizAll, a flying orb with gentle contours designed to put citizens at ease, with a central eye, stubby fins, and relentlessly cheerful speech patterns. @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}’s Sunward Corporation produces the more disconcerting Arbitron, whose insectile form mimics those of the resident anacites, while @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}’s Bluescale Industries crafts theirs to resemble tiny, mechanical drakes. Regardless of their shape, however, observers are known for their convenience, but they are infamous for their limited nuance—a problem for owners who forget their own security passphrase. Some of the cheapest models also have faulty programming that causes them to develop personality quirks, making a particular bot act especially aggressive, friendly, or even dejected.<br><br>Patrol-class security robots are more humanoid in shape, standing about 6 feet tall with integrated armaments that keep the robots’ limbs free to apprehend offenders and engage in close combat. Given their deadlier weaponry and tougher armor plating, patrol-class security robots (sometimes simply called “patrol bots”) are more regulated in their sale and use. They are found mostly in large space stations and corporate facilities under government or syndicate control. As with observer-class robots, these models run the gamut from four-armed Idaran Peacekeepers to the artistic Castrovelian Linewalkers that guard against dangerous jungle beasts, yet the overwhelming industry leader is AbadarCorp’s Town Guard series. With blank, circular faces of glass or glowing energy and cleanly contoured limbs capable of folding up for easy storage, AbadarCorp’s patrol bot is a triumph of industrial design and defense. This model’s reputation has been further boosted due to the fact that it’s the only model of patrol bot currently used by @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}’s government, with many going straight into service from the corporation’s manufactories in the Spike.<br><br>Unfortunately, not all security bots end up working for law-abiding corporations or state governments. Various planets in the Pact Worlds system have their own rules about who is or is not licensed to own a security robot, and the Pact Worlds government generally finds it easier to look the other way than to get embroiled in the contentious issues of rights-to- weapons and planetary sovereignty. As a result, it’s not difficult for individuals to purchase security robots entirely unregulated on the black market, albeit at a high cost. In cases where a world outlaws such sales, these models are usually formerly legal models that have been stolen and cracked by hacker gangs, while in other places corporations quietly sell to known criminal enterprises without asking questions. Such security robots are sometimes marked by their owners to show their “allegiance”—they might be painted with gang symbols or have their heads replaced with disturbing mannequin busts. Other groups maintain their robots’ official appearances, the better to carry out kidnappings and extortion. Because of this, passersby occasionally stumble across pitched firefights between squads of similar-looking security robots. Those who wish to get involved must be careful to identify each side’s master, as they could find themselves unintentionally taking sides in a gang war.<br><br>Though both observer and patrol models have safeguards to protect against it, glitches can occasionally develop in a security robot’s firmware, often the result of massive damage sustained during a firefight or improper diagnostics after such an altercation. In such cases, the glitch can override the bot’s usual baselevel programming regarding tiers of force and the logic of conflict escalation, or even its protocol to protect the innocent. This can result in a bloody rampage, with the robot either going berserk over perceived violation of nonexistent laws, or technically following the law but executing lethal punishment for even the smallest infraction. Even worse, an infected patrol bot’s nanites can carry its corrupted code like a virus, turning other security robots rogue. When this occurs, manufacturers like AbadarCorp are usually quick to hire discreet “contractors” to deal with the menace (as maintaining their own strike-and-disassembly force would publicly acknowledge the threat).</p>"

			"description": "<p>Security robots come in a wide variety of makes and models, with a near-endless variety of customizations based on both the manufacturer and the aesthetics and needs of the consumer. Crafted with advanced user interfaces mimicking moderate intelligence, but without any of the emotions, unpredictability, or bias of a true AI or sentient creature, security bots are an eminently practical, reasonable solution to a wide variety of security needs. Unlike full-on military models, security robots usually come preprogrammed with certain fail-safes preventing them from engaging in violence beyond what&rsquo;s necessary for the protection of their assigned population or property, making them a go-to option for police forces, corporations, and even wealthy individuals looking for peace of mind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the cheapest and most common types of security robot is the observer. Observer-class bots are usually small, flying robots designed primarily to record and report specific unsavory activities for later review by their owners, though they are also equipped to fend off minor threats. Whether buzzing through the access ducts of secure facilities or hovering over crowded marketplaces, observers are nearly ubiquitous in some advanced settlements. On Absalom Station, the most prominent brand is AbadarCorp&rsquo;s VizAll, a flying orb with gentle contours designed to put citizens at ease, with a central eye, stubby fins, and relentlessly cheerful speech patterns. Aballon&rsquo;s Sunward Corporation produces the more disconcerting Arbitron, whose insectile form mimics those of the resident anacites, while Triaxus&rsquo;s Bluescale Industries crafts theirs to resemble tiny, mechanical drakes. Regardless of their shape, however, observers are known for their convenience, but they are infamous for their limited nuance&mdash;a problem for owners who forget their own security passphrase. Some of the cheapest models also have faulty programming that causes them to develop personality quirks, making a particular bot act especially aggressive, friendly, or even dejected.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patrol-class security robots are more humanoid in shape, standing about 6 feet tall with integrated armaments that keep the robots&rsquo; limbs free to apprehend offenders and engage in close combat. Given their deadlier weaponry and tougher armor plating, patrol-class security robots (sometimes simply called &ldquo;patrol bots&rdquo;) are more regulated in their sale and use. They are found mostly in large space stations and corporate facilities under government or syndicate control. As with observer-class robots, these models run the gamut from four-armed Idaran Peacekeepers to the artistic Castrovelian Linewalkers that guard against dangerous jungle beasts, yet the overwhelming industry leader is AbadarCorp&rsquo;s Town Guard series. With blank, circular faces of glass or glowing energy and cleanly contoured limbs capable of folding up for easy storage, AbadarCorp&rsquo;s patrol bot is a triumph of industrial design and defense. This model&rsquo;s reputation has been further boosted due to the fact that it&rsquo;s the only model of patrol bot currently used by Absalom Station&rsquo;s government, with many going straight into service from the corporation&rsquo;s manufactories in the Spike.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not all security bots end up working for law-abiding corporations or state governments. Various planets in the Pact Worlds system have their own rules about who is or is not licensed to own a security robot, and the Pact Worlds government generally finds it easier to look the other way than to get embroiled in the contentious issues of rights-to- weapons and planetary sovereignty. As a result, it&rsquo;s not difficult for individuals to purchase security robots entirely unregulated on the black market, albeit at a high cost. In cases where a world outlaws such sales, these models are usually formerly legal models that have been stolen and cracked by hacker gangs, while in other places corporations quietly sell to known criminal enterprises without asking questions. Such security robots are sometimes marked by their owners to show their &ldquo;allegiance&rdquo;&mdash;they might be painted with gang symbols or have their heads replaced with disturbing mannequin busts. Other groups maintain their robots&rsquo; official appearances, the better to carry out kidnappings and extortion. Because of this, passersby occasionally stumble across pitched firefights between squads of similar-looking security robots. Those who wish to get involved must be careful to identify each side&rsquo;s master, as they could find themselves unintentionally taking sides in a gang war.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Though both observer and patrol models have safeguards to protect against it, glitches can occasionally develop in a security robot&rsquo;s firmware, often the result of massive damage sustained during a firefight or improper diagnostics after such an altercation. In such cases, the glitch can override the bot&rsquo;s usual baselevel programming regarding tiers of force and the logic of conflict escalation, or even its protocol to protect the innocent. This can result in a bloody rampage, with the robot either going berserk over perceived violation of nonexistent laws, or technically following the law but executing lethal punishment for even the smallest infraction. Even worse, an infected patrol bot&rsquo;s nanites can carry its corrupted code like a virus, turning other security robots rogue. When this occurs, manufacturers like AbadarCorp are usually quick to hire discreet &ldquo;contractors&rdquo; to deal with the menace (as maintaining their own strike-and-disassembly force would publicly acknowledge the threat).</p>"

Centuries ago, when the Aeon Throne mandated the presence of an adjutant robot on all large starships and in every military engagement, most officers were pleased with the aid.<br><br>Shortly afterward, rumors began to circulate that the imperially mandated robots were not mere helpers, but spies for the Aeon Throne, recording and transmitting information about their assigned officers to loyalty evaluators.

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Beneath layers of synthskin and expert disguises, every infiltration robot is basically identical. A spindly, humanoid machine&rsquo;s frame between 4 and 6 feet in height, lacking any feature that might indicate some specific design inspiration. By design, however, this interior is rarely seen. To most, an infiltration robot simply looks like some humanoid they know: a grocer, a pilot, or even a coworker with a penchant for cheesy snacks.</p>\n<p>These disguises are made possible by the synthskin that coats every infiltration robot. Synthskin is a pliable, synthetic substance that can be tuned to perfectly mimic a variety of humanoid species, even simulating blood and internal organs. Paired with an adjustable chassis, synthskin allows infiltration robots to be built as near-perfect replicas of a variety of&nbsp;humanoid species and subspecies. Social mimicry is handled by advanced processing centers that border on true AI, allowing for swift swapping between simulated personalities as well as resulting in all the quirks and personality development of intelligent life.</p>\n<p>The most basic form of infiltration robot is the monitor class. Monitors are primarily meant to observe and report upon their targets. While capable of combat, and in theory assassination, it is generally considered a last resort. Whatever information the monitor can get back to its controller is likely far more valuable than anyone it could reasonably kill, and damage from combat risks revealing the mechanical nature of the spy. As such, if a monitor initiates combat is likely believes that it has been found out, or that something far more valuable than its mission is at stake.</p>\n<p>More advanced by far are exterminator-class infiltration robots. Exterminators feature prototype nanobot swarms embedded in their chassis, allowing them to shrug off damage and swiftly repair their synthskin if it is damaged in battle. They can also effortlessly reshape their synthskin, changing their height, color, gender expression, apparent age, and species on the fly. This makes them both more resilient in battle and far more adaptable as assassins than monitor-class robots, as they can shift disguises as often as needed to approach virtually any target unsuspected. This adaptability also makes them much more aggressive; exterminators whose disguise is compromised can simply shift into another, so they are much more likely to initiate deadly combat without concern for their discovery.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or conspiracy (2&ndash;4)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

They are able to communicate with few life-forms via their language, Orbian, as it is ancient and almost unknown to outsiders. Instead, they seek to connect directly with the minds of those they meet, supplementing their telepathy by flashing images or scenes onto the mist they emit from their surface.

A curious and rarely observed aspect of purple orbs is their bonding process. Clusters of three to six orbs at advanced stages of their life cycle sometimes opt to bond themselves to each other for the remainder of their existence, forming a single life-form called a luminant with vastly heightened capabilities resulting from their collective knowledge. Sightings of purple orbs are sporadic, though not necessarily uncommon; they&rsquo;re spotted in large numbers for short periods of time, then seem to almost completely disappear from the entirety of the Pact Worlds for a year or longer. Those who have studied purple orbs have noted that each time they reappear, it&rsquo;s in lower numbers than before.</p>\n<h2>PURPLE CORES</h2>\n<p>When a purple orb dies, its perfect spherical shape gradually collapses, condensing into a jagged crystalline object known as a purple core. Sapient purple orbs mourn the loss of their kind, but they reject the remnant crystals as anything other than inert (albeit magical) matter&mdash;there is no reverence for physical remains among purple orbs. However, other species have come to value the orbs&rsquo; crystalline cores for their magical properties, with some evil individuals even contracting assassins and poachers for the purpose of obtaining them.</p>\n<p>Purple cores are a special material (Starfinder Core Rulebook 191) that can be incorporated into crafted shields and armor. The cost of enhancing a piece of equipment with purple core is equal to 10% of the price of the equipment. A piece of equipment can benefit from a maximum of one purple core.</p>\n<p>Purple core&ndash;enhanced equipment glows a deep purple and emits a fine lavender mist; this mist has no mechanical effect. The first time each combat that a character wielding a shield or wearing armor enhanced by a purple core is hit by an attack, the equipment erupts in excandescent light, and the attacker must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 15 + half the level of the equipment) or be dazzled for 1d4 rounds. If the attacker rolls a natural 1 (the result on the d20 is a 1) or fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is blinded for 1 round instead.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n</section>"

Sightings of purple orbs are sporadic, though not necessarily uncommon; they&rsquo;re spotted in large numbers for short periods of time, then seem to almost completely disappear from the entirety of the Pact Worlds for a year or longer. Those who have studied purple orbs have noted that each time they reappear, it&rsquo;s in lower numbers than before.</p>\n<h2>PURPLE CORES</h2>\n<p>When a purple orb dies, its perfect spherical shape gradually collapses, condensing into a jagged crystalline object known as a purple core. Sapient purple orbs mourn the loss of their kind, but they reject the remnant crystals as anything other than inert (albeit magical) matter&mdash;there is no reverence for physical remains among purple orbs. However, other species have come to value the orbs&rsquo; crystalline cores for their magical properties, with some evil individuals even contracting assassins and poachers for the purpose of obtaining them.</p>\n<p>Purple cores are a special material (Starfinder Core Rulebook 191) that can be incorporated into crafted shields and armor. The cost of enhancing a piece of equipment with purple core is equal to 10% of the price of the equipment. A piece of equipment can benefit from a maximum of one purple core.</p>\n<p>Purple core&ndash;enhanced equipment glows a deep purple and emits a fine lavender mist; this mist has no mechanical effect. The first time each combat that a character wielding a shield or wearing armor enhanced by a purple core is hit by an attack, the equipment erupts in excandescent light, and the attacker must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 15 + half the level of the equipment) or be dazzled for 1d4 rounds. If the attacker rolls a natural 1 (the result on the d20 is a 1) or fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is blinded for 1 round instead.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Time breaks all things down, as all creation marches inexorably toward chaos and oblivion.<br><br>Many eons ago, a long-vanished civilization took offense to this cosmic truth and conceived of an all-purpose gel—equal parts magic and nanotechnology—that could repair nearly anything, including flesh. At some point in that civilization’s history, perhaps due to some industrial accident, a vat of this gel gained a limited sentience and began to reproduce in dark corners and sewers.<br><br>Despite all their advanced technology, the civilization eventually collapsed—perhaps even as a result of being overrun by their own creation—but the sentient gel survived, hitching rides on the hulls and in the cramped cargo bays of their progenitor race’s scattering survivors. Released onto other worlds, the gel continued to evolve and adapt, becoming the scrounging, hoarding blobs of protoplasm now generally referred to as scavenger slimes. These oozes now lurk in ruins across the galaxy, gluing together elaborate, snaillike shells for themselves from detritus and jury-rigging whatever technology they find into half-functioning weaponry.<br><br>Scavenger slimes are lumps of protoplasm measuring about 6 feet across. Though mindless, they have an intuitive understanding of order and technological systems, allowing them to patch or repair nearly anything they encounter, though rarely into a form as reliable or attractive as it may have once been. Actually using these items is often beyond them— an ooze might rebuild a hovercar, but have no idea how to operate it, unable to even grasp its purpose. Similarly, an ooze might repair a datapad, yet have no concept what the sights and sounds it displays are attempting to communicate. The sole exception to this principle is weapons: through whatever mechanism, scavenger slimes long ago gained the ability to direct and trigger the weapons they rebuild, instinctively understanding what they’re for and how to use them in their own defense, treating them like specially adapted limbs.<br><br>The key to a scavenger slime’s survival mechanisms is the dense resin it secretes, which it uses to bind pieces together or form rudimentary tools on its pseudopods. Scavenger slimes can even vary the conductivity of this resin, allowing them to patch and repair technology. This ability contributes to the scavenger slime’s most iconic feature: durable, snaillike shells each creature fashions from whatever trash it encounters. How these mindless creatures select and shape the components of their shells remains a mystery, but each supports a sophisticated and uniquely evolved life-support system that protects the ooze from vacuum. Most scavenger slimes also incorporate various kitbashed weapons into their shells, making them formidable opponents to even well-equipped adventurers.<br><br>Scavenger oozes are the bane of adventurers and treasure hunters exploring ancient ruins and abandoned space stations. Heavily armored and armed, they defend garbage heaps and treasure troves with ferocity, and whatever priceless technology they uncover is quickly disassembled and glued into their shells or incorporated into new weapons.<br><br>Their hundreds of eggs—each barely the size of a grain of rice—cling to clothing and boots, allowing them to easily spread to new environments or even starships, where they quietly grow in dark crevices, causing random system failures until the young slimes begin tearing into ship’s vital components. Despite the danger scavenger slimes pose, some creatures find them endlessly delightful. Gremlins find kinship in their destructive nature, while space goblins share the slimes’ habitats and gift for rebuilding technology. Some pirate crews have also learned to seed long-haul freighters with scavenger slime eggs, then follow from a safe distance until the oozes shut down their victims’ defenses.<br><br>While the vast majority of scavenger slimes tear down and rebuild technology, a small variant population exists that instead tears down organic beings to “maintain” them. These rare gene-scavenger slimes construct semiliving shells from bones, hide, and organs of whatever creatures they encounter, incorporating strange special abilities from various aliens and monsters. These advanced scavenger slimes demonstrate a far wider range of special abilities than their technologically inclined kin, and they engage trespassers with horrifying enthusiasm, dragging living victims away to break down—sometimes while still conscious—into new parts for their macabre armor.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scavenger Slime Grenades</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The scavenger slime’s sticky resin can be used as makeshift stickybomb grenades (<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> 178). A slain scavenger slime, when properly harvested in treated glass vessels, yields up to 20 item levels’ worth of stickybomb grenades—so 2 stickybomb grenades III (each level 10), or 5 stickybomb grenades II (each level 4), and so on. Harvesting the slime in this manner requires a DC 28 Engineering or Life Science check—success means you acquire all the desired stickybombs, while failure deals 2d10+13 bludgeoning damage to you as the slime revitalizes just long enough to attack you. This check can be attempted only once per scavenger slime corpse.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Slime-Patch Systems</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">While most spacefarers know better than to try and harness scavenger slimes’ technology, given the obvious dangers involved, the oozes’ ability to quickly adapt and repair systems has made them surprisingly useful tools for those starship engineers daring enough to employ them. Slime-patch systems can be installed in any starship for 8 Build Points, with no expansion bay or PCU cost. When a ship with slime-patch systems acquires a critical damage condition, the slime-patch system automatically turns on, spraying the damaged systems with scavenger slime material almost like a fire-sprinkler system. The slime, which is chemically treated to die within moments of its unexpected freedom, automatically begins repairing the system, reducing the number of engineering actions required to patch the critical damage condition by 1 (minimum 1).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or work crew (3-10)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"name": "Seen, The",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Modern science has drawn back the curtain on countless mysteries of the universe, but the Seen, known only by an enigmatic proper noun conferred on them by those familiar with the strange creatures, are emblematic of mortal creatures&rsquo; still-limited understanding of quantum mechanics. The Seen have the disconcerting property of changing completely, down to the molecular level, when they are observed&mdash;whether by a creature or&nbsp;technology. Strangely, this shift appears to be automatic and instantaneous. Whether this ability arose through natural selection or some stranger method, their shifting forms make the Seen formidable ambush predators: lightning-fast, able to move through barriers while unobserved, and capable of destroying multiple targets at once even after they&rsquo;ve been spotted.</p>\n<p>The Seen&rsquo;s deadly nature and inability (or perhaps refusal) to communicate with other life-forms makes them a challenge to study, and biologists have conflicting opinions on what the Seen do with their prey. No sightings have ever been reported of the Seen eating their victims, and in fact, they don&rsquo;t appear to have mouths&mdash;though since their physical structures change upon being sighted, there&rsquo;s no telling what they look like unobserved. In their observed form, they appear as gangly humanoids whose four limbs each end in a single, massive talon, with sharp spikes flaying out from their upper abdomen. Their uncanny speed when invisible, paired with strange galloping noises heard by survivors, have led to myths and horror stories of spindly creatures that sprint on four unnaturally long legs. This frightening image has made the Seen a common feature in popular horror media and infosphere conspiracy theory forums alike.</p>\n<p>Attempts to research the Seen have almost universally ended in unmitigated disaster. The first such venture, an infamous experiment that gave the creatures their name, was led by a kasathan biophysics lab aboard the @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}. Researchers paid a large sum of credits to a small group of mercenaries to bring them one of the creatures alive and mostly unharmed. After only two days of keeping the creature in captivity, a blast of force hit the lab and the surrounding area, sending all equipment offline. When help eventually arrived to investigate, everyone involved in the project had vanished.</p>\n<p>However, the blast didn&rsquo;t destroy all the data that the research team had already collected, leading to a shocking discovery made while reviewing the surviving surveillance footage: when the lab was closed and empty of other creatures, hidden cameras pointed at the Seen were enough to prevent it from changing to its unobserved form, even with no other lifeforms present to observe it. The implication that the monster&rsquo;s biology somehow responded to the mere presence of a technological observer shook the scientific world to the core. Researchers now had to contend with the possibility that a living, multicellular organism could behave on a molecular level the same way that light or individual particles do, with the mere presence of a sensor being enough to alter the creature&rsquo;s fundamental properties.</p>\n<p>Further attempts to study the elusive creatures have met with similar fates; small parties sent to investigate sightings never return, and even the members of larger expeditions or task forces have vanished without a trace. Even without being able to communicate with the Seen, anyone who has faced one and lived to tell the tale can attest to their intelligence. The aberrations are sometimes encountered in pairs or even small packs that seem to work together to confound and corner their prey, though such encounters have presented no clear pattern as to the Seen&rsquo;s preferred environment, and no confirmed sightings have reported evidence of a nest or some other kind of dwelling or territory.</p>\n<p>One theory, which is mostly common among the more fringe elements of the scientific community, is that the Seen are in fact extraplanar beings that appear in the Material Plane only to feed. This theory is perhaps supported by the fact that the Seen rarely leave behind corpses of their victims, though skeptics argue that this is simply because the Seen swallow their meals whole once there&rsquo;s no one left to witness their feast. A relatively recent hypothesis about the Seen&rsquo;s potential origin and motivations is growing in popularity. Its primary proponent, a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} witchwarper named Hyeldar Zon Deamis, posits that the Seen hail from alternate realities, and are in fact researchers of a sort in their own right, not murdering but capturing and transporting them for study wherever it is they call home. Scientific journals and infosphere amateurs alike fiercely debate these and many other contrasting theories, but the truth remains that very little is known about the Seen. Formal studies are exceedingly rare due to their often-fatal conclusions,&nbsp;though there are still fairly regular calls throughout the galaxy for adventurers willing to try to track down and capture the creatures for further examination. Such expeditions often offer rich rewards&mdash;which, as noted by the cynical, is likely because the odds of a crew living long enough to collect payment are so slim.</p>\n<h3>QUANTUM FUSIONS</h3>\n<p>Research into the workings of the Seen has yielded surprising innovations in quantum technology. One of these is the quantum weapon fusion, which causes a ranged weapon to appear to constantly shimmer and jump between two slightly different states. Still, there is yet much to learn about perfecting the technology, and several corporations are investing heavily in research and development with an aim toward applying the innovation to melee weapons&mdash;though this has thus far proven too unstable and dangerous for the user.</p>\n<p>Three times per day as a standard action, you can use a quantum weapon to make two ranged attacks, each against a different target. After learning the result of each attack, you must pick one attack to ignore (it doesn&rsquo;t hit or expend ammunition and has no effects) and apply the effects of the other attack (such as damage and critical hit effects) as normal. This fusion can be applied only to ranged weapons.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or pack (3&ndash;6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<p>Shadow hoppers are rabbit-like creatures with charcoalcolored fur and vicious claws and teeth. Despite their terrifying appearance, shadow hoppers are generally peaceful and even quite playful. They spend the majority of their lives in their harmless-looking forms, which usually look like cuter and smaller versions of their standard shapes. Shadow hoppers prefer the company of other intelligent creatures and often dwell near rural settlements. While in their innocuous forms, some shadow hoppers allow people to “adopt” them as pets, though this usually ends in aggravation for that family, as shadow hoppers are inveterate tricksters.<br><br>Shadow hoppers enjoy playing pranks and causing general mischief: moving objects while no one is looking, taking small bites out of others’ food, telepathically whispering secrets to those around them, and occasionally sabotaging electronic devices. Their shenanigans are not typically meant to cause harm, but an overexcited shadow hopper can easily get carried away, especially when two or more work together to incite chaos. Sometimes, groups of shadow hoppers will gather to try to cause as much mischief and mayhem as they can in one night. Largely, though, shadow hoppers tend to be solitary creatures and don’t like to settle in areas where another shadow hopper already lives.<br><br>Scholars argue whether shadow hoppers are originally from the First World or the Shadow Plane, as they exhibit traits common to both fey and beings of shadow. Some believe shadow hoppers began their existence in one of these locations and somehow migrated to the other before coming to the Material Plane. Most shadow hoppers, however, refuse to speculate on their origins.</p>"

			"description": "<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Shakaltas are a species of highly intuitive psychic entities that inhabit Accara IV, a planet in the Vast with a very short day-night cycle. Each shakalta is born as a soul, appearing as a mote of glowing energy with a vague face and fully developed mind. A juvenile inherits a great amount of knowledge and spends their first few years receiving intensive telepathic education from their parents. A shakalta develops their identity and personality during this time. After a few years, a shakalta child is considered ready to become an adult.<br><br>To enter adulthood, two shakalta souls must bond together. Young shakaltas travel to Accara IV seeking a partner to bond with. Psychic compatibility and spiritual connection are all that matter to potential soul partners, and both souls must consent for this bonding to work. The deep link between bonded shakalta souls is one that surpasses trust and love. When two shakaltas agree to bond, they intertwine, creating a body of coherent energy to share, living the rest of their lives in this intimate proximity.<br><br>A shakalta’s body has only one soul controlling outward activities at a given time. The inactive soul recedes and rests, conscious only of its mate. Cosmetic changes in the body reffect the active soul’s sense of itself. These visual variations allow nonpsychic creatures to tell each soul from the other.<br><br>The culture of the shakaltas is deeply spiritual. Arrival in the galaxy as energy makes it easy for shakaltas to value knowledge, mysticism, and other immaterial concepts over objects and wealth. Shakaltas revere @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.rUtAoz8NUGCZR4yz]{Yaraesa}, the light of wisdom, and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VJ0UTIsAggcCQJBu]{Sarenrae}, the light of life. The two deities are often represented together in shakalta shrines, as separate luminosities unified in an eternal balance. Shakaltas spend their long lives seeking experiences and attempting to bring light and positivity to existence. Many shakaltas remain on Accara IV, gathering in family-like groups and living lives of quiet devotion to their deities, philosophy, and one another. However, some shakaltas feel a calling to leave their home world for a greater purpose. Members of the shakalta Star-Guardians exemplify this urge, their loose coalition dedicated to traveling the galaxy and defending it against evil.<br><br>The shakalta belief in the balance of dualities extends even to life and death. When a shakalta decides to reproduce, each bonded soul contributes vitality to create a kernel of psychic energy. The shakalta carries this “embryo” inside their body for 18 months. A juvenile shakalta called a neophyte then emerges without effort, immediately ready to begin its education. Conversely, some shakaltas agree to peacefully end their lives before natural death, seeing their passing as another avenue of exploration. Shakaltas believe their souls reincarnate and that bonded souls can find their partners in the next life, which might not be as shakaltas.<br><br>Shakaltas average 6-1/2 feet in height and weigh about 100 pounds. Shakaltas live for well over 500 years.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Accara IV)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Offense</h2>\n<h3>Connection</h3>\n<p>star shaman</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

		"Shantak": {
			"name": "Shantak",
			"description": "<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Shantaks are bizarre, winged creatures that seem to be an incongruous blend of reptile and bird. Although shantaks appear ungainly on land when perched on their two legs, their vast, bat-like wings enable the creatures to soar gracefully through vacuum as easily as they fly in atmospheres. Slimy scales cover a shantak’s body, and its vaguely horselike head features a wide maw filled with dagger-like teeth. A shantak is about 30 feet long from nose to tail and weighs approximately 6,000 pounds. Planetside, shantaks inhabit remote and foreboding mountain peaks, but their ability to survive in and fly through vacuum means they can also be found in the void of space.<br><br>Despite their bestial appearances, shantaks are intelligent, and speak in shrill voices that sound like glass grinding against stone. They are willful creatures and cannot simply be trained as mounts. A would-be shantak rider must first seek out a shantak, braving its lair or hunting grounds, and then use diplomacy or magic to secure a shantak’s cooperation as a mount, often with a liberal dose of flattery. Even then, shantaks have a tendency to deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas, or worse, revoke their shared defenses while in the depths of space so their riders asphyxiate and swiftly perish. The flesh of such unfortunate riders is particularly delightful to a shantak, especially if it is able to feed where the rider’s one-time allies and friends can watch.<br><br>Many shantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain humanoid winged creatures, such as faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain dreams, or specific types of winged humanoids more common in civilized regions. While these irrational fears are usually not so overwhelming as to have physical or mental effects on a shantak, shantaks do take pains to avoid confrontations with these other types of creatures if at all possible.<br><br>Shantaks’ ability to travel the gulf of space ensures that these scaly creatures can be found on numerous worlds and their satellites. Yet despite this ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds on their own unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the depths of space. Before the widespread use of Drift technology, some species employed shantaks as a rare and dangerous method of traveling among the stars, and there may well be as-yet-undiscovered civilizations in the Vast that continue to do so—perhaps because their technological advancement has not reached a level where they can use Drift travel.<br><br>Curiously, even those who have never encountered a shantak in real life often know of these creatures, for shantaks dwell in the shared dreams of slumbering minds as surely as in the depths of space. Some scientists and philosophers have gone so as far as to suggest that shantaks first hailed from a mysterious shared demiplane within the Dimension of Dreams called the Dreamlands. These scholars further posit that eerie and dangerous rituals have enabled the creatures to transform themselves from figments imagined by sleeping minds into creatures that exist in the waking world on countless planets.<br><br>Although shantaks do not enjoy the presence of active starships—almost as if the energies exuded by an active power core cause them some sort of intense discomfort— shantaks are quite fond of derelict ships. Large numbers of shantaks have been reported to roost in the nooks and crannies of a drifting hulk’s hull, and exploration of the interior of these abandoned ships often reveals truly disturbing “caches” of food—the partially eaten remains of entire crews. Shantaks that roost in derelict starships take full advantage of their adoptive homes, ensuring their nests are well hidden from observation. These shantaks can be quite cunning in dressing the hulk in what appears to be valuable scrap, and some have even learned to tamper with shipboard alarm systems to send out false distress signals. The most cunning and dangerous of these drifting traps arise when the shantaks forge an alliance with another creature, often an undead created when a starship is destroyed. A shantak flock can wing off to distant worlds to retrieve rare necessities for their allies, returning via spaceflight to keep the denizen of a stranded derelict well supplied in luxuries that, without their own ship to command, they would otherwise be forced to forgo.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shantak Whistles</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">While the advent of Drift technology has made interstellar travel accessible to the masses, not everyone is comfortable with using starships to travel. Some have philosophical reasons for avoiding @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}, while others take offense at the notion of answering to the whim of a starship captain. Many have goals among the stars that they prefer not to share with others. Whatever the reason, the opportunity to travel atop a shantak’s slippery back remains the preferred (and perhaps only viable) option for some. A shantak whistle is a sought-after tool for those who wish to find a shantak mount.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>cold mountains or vacuum</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or flock (3-12)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

		"Sharpwing": {
			"name": "Sharpwing",
			"description": "Sharpwings are fierce and fast carnivores found mainly in and soaring between the Ice Wells of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}—deep craters filled with a surprising variety of biological life that most people wouldn’t associate with the predominantly machine-occupied planet. Those who encroach on sharpwing territory know that the only way to survive an encounter with the deadly predator is to bring it down before it draws close enough to attack with its devastating talons. Even such an undertaking is fraught with risk, as the creatures slice through the sky at such speeds that few have a chance of firing more than once or twice before the creature’s razor claws descend. Sneaking up on a sharpwing is next to impossible thanks to the sensors covering its sleek body and wings, and while the beast is flying, it almost always sees its prey long before the prey is aware of its presence.<br><br>Fortunately for other creatures, these long-ranging hunters typically fly alone. One sharpwing is a dangerous foe, with little preference in the creatures it hunts. A pair can be deadly even to an experienced adventurer, especially if the creatures happen to be defending a nest or a newly hatched keenling, and woe unto the foolish explorer who stumbles the creatures roosting along the edges of an Ice Well crater. Only in lean times will the creatures take to the sky as a group to hunt, but when they do, they have been known to bring down prey several times their size.<br><br>Sharpwing breeding season lasts for several months each year, during which an unpaired male sharpwing’s many visual sensors begin to blink rapidly. Biologists believe that this fast blinking signals to unpaired female sharpwings that the male’s sensors are strong and plentiful. In areas where the male sharpwing population is greater than the female population, multiple unpaired males sometimes gather in a circle around a female and spread their wings, trying to showcase as many of their sensors as possible. The female sharpwing then chooses a suitable mate from among the suitors by pecking sharply at his forehead. A sharpwing lays only three or four eggs at a time, and the parents remain paired until all the eggs have hatched, as they both have connections to them after they are laid.<br><br>Sharpwing eggs are covered with the same organs that cover a sharpwing’s body, and sharpwing parents have the curious ability to see through those eyes. Many scholars believe this connection is possible due to a genetic form of quantum entanglement the creatures evolved thanks to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}’s natural radiation. Others posit that the First Ones are responsible for tinkering with the species’ genetic code millennia ago. In addition, and slightly more puzzling to biologists, is the eggs’ ability to sprout slender legs and flee threats perceived through these same sensors. Such movement is of questionable evolutionary benefit, as it is neither swift nor stealthy and has been known to result in the eggs tumbling down cliffs, sinking into bodies of water, or otherwise ensuring their own destruction.<br><br>Sharpwings’ unusual biology provides multitudinous opportunities in arcane, biogenetic, and technological research and development, but it has led to overeager researchers turning to or becoming game hunters. Paying to acquire a sharpwing or one of their eggs is a costly endeavor, and even more so for living specimens. Some entrepreneurs have captured sharpwings to breed them as a commodity, leading to out-of-control invasive populations of the predators on planets far from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}. However, they are on the brink of extinction on their home world due to this same increasing demand and the planet’s ever-expanding urban sprawl. This threat to the species (and the threat sharpwings pose to species on other worlds) has drawn the attention of the Xenowardens, and discussion of trade sanctions now threatens to push the breeding, capture, and trade of sharpwings and their eggs into the black market, where it will undoubtedly flourish and possibly hasten the species’ demise.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ocucloaks</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">For centuries, military organizations have striven to give their fighters the same type of battlefield awareness granted by a sharpwing’s many eyes. In the past, certain arcane scholars have re-created this ability with unstable magic, sometimes with unfortunate (and grotesque) consequences. Early tests with clothing studded with nanocameras linked to a pair of bulky goggles left most users disoriented and queasy. More recent studies of sharpwing egg anatomy and advances in modern biotechnology have enabled the creation of an organic microprocessor that attaches to the user’s occipital lobe, giving her the ability to interpret visual signals generated by sensors woven into a piece of clothing known to many manufacturers as an ocucloak. The most popular models of the following biotechnological augmentation (<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> 208) and the attached garment are produced by Brethedan companies.</p>"

		"Shipkiller Bulb": {
			"name": "Shipkiller Bulb",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>A massive species of spaceborne plants inhabits the rocky rings of gas giants throughout the galaxy. Known to Pact Worlds scientists as greater ring roots, these creatures resemble&nbsp;immense, hirsute tubers bristling with gnarled tendrils and alien eyes. However, countless tragedies since the Gap have earned the infamous plant its more common name: the shipkiller bulb.</p>\n<p>Like most plants, a shipkiller bulb subsists on a combination of minerals and photosynthesis, both of which are difficult to secure in their habitat. Many gas giants&rsquo; great distance from their respective suns leave the bulbs relatively starved for light, so when the plants orbit along their planets&rsquo; sun-facing sides, they unfurl their compact leaves into huge panels that catch as much light as possible. For water, the bulbs capture the rings&rsquo; ice crystals or draw frozen water out of debris, and they break apart the minerals in ring dust or descend into upper atmospheres to secure the necessary gases. In ideal circumstances, a shipkiller bulb takes root in an asteroid, slowly drains the rocky mass of essential minerals, and then discards the crumbling debris before seeking out a new host.</p>\n<p>Not only do shipkiller bulbs possess extraordinary patience, but they have exceptional gravitational abilities as well. Much of the bulb houses a specialized organ cluster which allows the plant to manipulate gravity, using it to push its body through space and drag in comets to consume. Gravity control is also critical to the bulbs&rsquo; propagation, as the plants combine their orbital momentum with their own telekinetic push to hurl seeds at tremendous speed across space. Most of these seeds are clones formed intermittently throughout its life, though each bulb blooms in a massive display of petals about once per century in order to reproduce sexually. These events draw opportunistic pollinators from the gas giants, and the resulting fruit clusters (known as brethebeans) are both delicious and among the most expensive produce in the Pact Worlds.</p>\n<p>Shipkiller bulbs are generally quite peaceful. When starships enter or exit @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} near a bulb, however, the resulting gravitational disturbances vex the plant like nails on a chalkboard. Disoriented and angry, an irritated shipkiller bulb acts erratically and often violently. In the best case, this involves fleeing the area or hurling nearby debris in frustration&mdash;a response that often inadvertently embeds the bulb&rsquo;s seeds in any starships within range. But when @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} event is especially close or the bulb is starved for nutrients, the plant earns its epithet. With a combination of powerful tendrils and pulses of gravity, a shipkiller bulb can tear open a starship&rsquo;s hull within seconds. In its rampage, the plant preferentially attacks living creatures, though it will still deal massive structural damage. A shipkiller bulb wrecks its target until it loses interest, is chased off by powerful defenses, or is sated by draining the starship&rsquo;s energy reserves, yet even a victorious crew might have to evacuate a vessel too damaged to repair. If left alone, a shipkiller bulb often lingers around the wreck for months, leeching nutrients from the hull until only a fragile shell remains.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, a concentrated burst of starship weapons fire is often enough to discourage a riled bulb. The catch is that shipkiller bulbs are extremely difficult to detect, as the same gravitational fields they use for feeding also interfere with most forms of starship sensors. As a result, the first sign of a plant could be the sound of it tearing apart a vessel&rsquo;s bulkhead. At least one specialized scanner design developed by the Xenowardens can reliably detect shipkiller bulbs, though the technology is neither widespread nor easy to integrate into fully technological starships. Foraging vessels that harvest the rare brethebeans are often equipped with specialized gravity scanners that have limited use beyond picking up the plants&rsquo; unique signatures, but the technology&rsquo;s price and power requirements make it impractical for most vessels.</p>\n<p>Thanks to their stealth, longevity, and far-flung seeds, shipkiller bulbs can theoretically appear anywhere in the galaxy, especially in debris fields, asteroid belts, and planetary rings. The population around @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda} has largely been exterminated following violent Drift incidents, though rogue bulbs periodically resurface around the gas giants or in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}. A seed even lodged in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}&rsquo;s Spike district, growing to the size of a car before being found and removed. @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} and similar settlements periodically organize bulb patrols designed primarily to uproot any shipkiller seeds while simultaneously serving to sniff out any other parasites or lurking dangers within the space stations&rsquo; less trafficked regions.</p>\n<h2>GRAVITY GRENADES</h2>\n<p>While shipkiller bulbs popularly represent death and destruction, the creatures&rsquo; gravity-controlling organs have contributed to major theoretical breakthroughs in gravity drives and particle physics. Yet the most practical technology developed from the bulb corpse is smaller: a grenade whose gravity net sustains and isolates a tiny singularity that implodes when released.</p>\n<p>Derived from the gravitational organs of shipkiller bulbs, gravity grenades generate a micro-singularity that pulls affected targets towards the detonation point. Creatures in the area move the listed distance toward the blast&rsquo;s center if they fail a Fortitude saving throw. Unsecured, unattended items of 1 bulk or less automatically fail this save. The force is not powerful enough to move bigger objects, such as Large vehicles.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any sky (gas giant) or vacuum</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

		"Skarak": {
			"name": "Skarak",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Skaraks are massive, eight-legged predators that resemble horned arachnids covered in patches of black, white, and blue bristles. Their 16-foot leg spans and 3-ton bodies bely a deadly agility, and skaraks can chase down even fleet prey with little difficulty before goring their victims and swallowing them whole. Those they can&rsquo;t reach they trap, either constructing devious pits or ensnaring their targets with lassos of sticky silk webs.</p>\n<p>Skaraks are exceptionally efficient eaters, securing nutrients from virtually all parts of a kill. Yet the creatures&rsquo; jaws are best designed for stabbing and pinning prey, not chewing, and their bony throat plates perform only cursory mastication. Instead, food travels through a series of four stomachs, similar to those of herbivorous ruminants. Powerful digestive acids break down carcasses (even the protective shells common to creatures on their home planet), and periodically transfer matter back to its throat for chewing during idle periods. The second stomach functions like a gizzard, gradually accumulating indigestible matter like stones and metal that help to grind food. Adventurers have found durable technological treasures inside this organ and also within the ambergris-like nodules the skaraks excrete. In times of limited prey, skaraks are known to graze on vegetation.</p>\n<p>Skarak webbing is as much a sensory tool as it is a weapon. With the help of magically attuned cerebral lobes, skaraks can sense magical pathways between their own position and their webs. By reaching through these invisible portals, skaraks can drag a web-ensnared target into a waiting mouth. This intuition appears completely unattuned to any other form of magic, yet witchwarping scholars are quick to connect skaraks&rsquo; space-bending abilities with their own magical tradition, even paying a bounty for fresh skarak silk to test and prove that it&rsquo;s from another reality.</p>\n<p>Unlike spider webs, skarak webs have only a short-lived adhesive that loses all but a modicum of stickiness after a few minutes&rsquo; exposure to most atmospheres, making the threads nearly useless for creating lasting traps. Instead, skaraks spin simple hunting lassos and weave shelters, drawing finger-thick silk from spinnerets on their back legs and directing it with foot-combs on their front legs.</p>\n<p>For all their resemblance to giant spiders, skaraks are highly analytical and expressive. A lone skarak might watch a settlement from afar for days to memorize behavioral patterns before launching a raid to snatch up prey at an opportune moment. But far more famously, skaraks are unabashed art critics, apparently delighting in beautiful visual expressions while vandalizing artwork that doesn&rsquo;t meet their standards. Many settlements near skarak territories have developed artistic traditions to shield their communities, ranging from dance festivals during the creatures&rsquo; mating seasons to funding public art installations as a form of self-defense. If the quality meets the predators&rsquo; standards, marauding skaraks often marvel at the art for hours before dispersing as if in a haze. They&rsquo;re far less adept at creating their own art, but they create nonetheless, building elaborate webs with interwoven baubles ranging from skulls and polished stones to spent rifle shells and dropped cred sticks. Occasionally, these web tapestries display scenes like nearby landmarks or animals, and a popular theory among adventurers is that these images act as treasure maps to hidden wealth.</p>\n<p>Skaraks are predominantly solitary, yet they gather in small groups during their mating season, which occurs roughly once every Pact Standard year. After filling the nights with the haunting sounds of their dances, skaraks breed and embark on a group hunt that lasts for weeks as they gorge to fuel egg development. This rampage carves literal trails of destruction, with the adults shattering architecture in their path as they dig shallow furrows and fill them with uneaten carcasses as food stores for their future offspring. After finding or hollowing out a subterranean nest, the skaraks lay their eggs and scatter, leaving the eggs to incubate for about 5 months before hatching.</p>\n<p>The newly hatched young instinctively retrace their parents&rsquo; rampage trail, eating any remaining carrion and hunting prey still in the area. Settlements nearby adapt to this cycle and often prioritize erasing these trails over repairing their own homes just to avoid the second wave of attack. A few warlords have even laid false trails to direct young skaraks against their enemies. More proactive settlements track down and burn these nests whenever possible. Yet skarak parents are canny. Not only do they typically kill off any other predators along their trail so that their young face little competition, they often leave only the weakest prey alive, ensuring their offspring can hone their hunting skills on hapless victims. As a result, some cultures view survivors of the first wave of skarak attacks as helplessly inept rather than lucky.</p>\n<p>Skaraks are organic creatures that seem to have reached several different systems before the Gap&mdash;ostensibly traveling with the help of their strange teleportation sense. Sometime during the Gap, the research company Homeworld Biotech apparently began an amoral and ill-advised genetic manipulation of skaraks to transform the creatures into docile livestock able to survive in nearly any environment. As the Gap ended, the untold decades of records from the program became garbled, yet initial tests suggested the skaraks were suitable for export. Needing income to stay afloat, Homeworld Biotech sold and shipped hundreds of their stock to at least a dozen planets before the disastrous reports started rolling in: once outside the labs, the skaraks turned on their herders and escaped. As criminal negligence accusations mounted, the company quietly dissolved, its upper management exploiting the recent Gap&rsquo;s lost records to restart their lives elsewhere. The skaraks survive as invasive species on an untold number of worlds.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any land</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or massacre (3&ndash;8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

They have a unique outlook: individualistic without being anarchic, and somehow unable (or perhaps unwilling) to grasp the concept of permanent governance. They understand and enjoy teamwork, and naturally follow a qualified leader to undertake large projects such as the building of domiciles, but once that task has been completed, the leader doesn’t continue to hold sway over the others. Coupled with their unusual life cycle, it would seem as if skittermanders would be very difficult to rule. But such is not exactly the case.<br><br>When vesk warships appeared in the sky, skittermanders across Vesk-3 were more than happy to get out of the invaders’ way—not out of fear, but more because of their innate desire to help.

They understand and enjoy teamwork, and naturally follow a qualified leader to undertake large projects such as the building of domiciles, but once that task has been completed, the leader doesn’t continue to hold sway over the others.

They stand 7 feet tall with&nbsp;chassis of multicolored glass, and a multitude of coiled, rootlike tentacles cascading from their waists. As a result of the resemblance they bear to floating trees, they are sometimes called trees of knowledge. Wyspirias use their tendrils to plug themselves into people and machines alike&mdash;a direct connection that allows them to quickly transfer huge quantities of data between connected people and devices.</p>\n<p>Whereas iridias come to the Prime Material Plane offering gifts of knowledge and technology to mortals, many believe wyspirias do the opposite, collecting libraries of secrets and information about the galaxy for the unseen purposes of spectra. Rarely, wyspirias are said to appear during the peace talks of warring civilizations, connecting the opposing delegates and enabling them to understand each other directly. Many believe these spectra intervene only when they deem the risk of losing technology or information from a conflict too great.</p>\n<p>Sondrias are a new variety of spectra primarily encountered inside the Drift. They are small and sharply featured, with six arms, razor talons, and round, flat, owlish faces. Sometimes called Drift pixies, their presence is always accompanied by a grainy, low-pitched hum or buzzing noise. Sondrias use their own voices more often than other types of spectra, and sequences of sondrias have a habit of speaking at the same time in overlapping sentences that are difficult to pick apart.</p>\n<p>Like the larger and more formidable aspecnas, sondrias patrol the Drift to help lost travelers and rescue marooned escape pods or starships whose Drift engines malfunction, latching onto the vessels and using their slip drives to boost them back to the Material Plane. It&rsquo;s rumored sequences of sondria can also offer @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}&rsquo;s blessing to those killed during Drift travel or in service of the All Code&rsquo;s agenda&mdash;by reincarnating them as androids.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (the Drift)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, sequence (2, 3, 5, or 8), or delegation (1 wyspiria plus 2 iridias)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

They speak of dreamlike beings that haunt the barren gorges and desert flats, apparitions from the bottom of a prehistoric ocean who drift and swim through the air. The most terrifying of these marine phantasms is known simply as the spookfish; though individually tiny, they rise from the sand in bloodthirsty swarms of flashing scales and serrated teeth. Each spectral fish is dotted with false eyespots along its flanks; this defensive camouflage has proven utterly disorienting to those hapless souls caught in a spookfish swarm.<br>Akitonian archaeologists have unearthed fossils of creatures with a physiology that matches the spookfish, and some speculate that the impact of a meteor evaporated the Irkonian Sea and obliterated the entire species in one fateful instant.

			"description": "<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Called vulkariki in Lashunta, squoxes gained their popular moniker from humans who thought the creatures resembled a cross between a fox and a squirrel, with useful qualities from both animals. Squoxes are furry, vulpine animals roughly 2 feet in length and weighing around 15 pounds. They are quadrupedal, with five-fingered prehensile paws that have rotating wrists and ankles, allowing them to climb down surfaces headfirst like a squirrel. The creature’s other features are fox-like, including a flattened head with triangular ears, a pointed snout, and a bushy tail. Squox fur can come in hues of red orange, gray, fulvous, white, or brown, with white on the belly, neck, and tail tip. The species also has an array of fur patterns and environmental adaptations, such as long ears that allow desert-dwelling squoxes to disperse heat and thick seasonal fur and coloration for those accustomed to arctic regions.<br><br>Squoxes are among the most intelligent animal species in the Pact Worlds, exhibiting social behaviors and hierarchies along with a vast vocal repertoire. When confronted, squoxes are devious tacticians, especially in groups. They are clever enough to poke eyes, bite sensitive regions, and steal objects to bait enemies away from a den.<br><br>Although they originated on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, squoxes gained popularity across the Pact Worlds for their adorable features and ability to adapt to new environments. The people of Asana happily exported squoxes, which lashuntas see as pests. Over centuries, squoxes spread and successfully adjusted to biomes across the Pact Worlds. They’ve even begun to appear in the wild in the Veskarium and worlds in the Vast.<br><br>Xenowardens have tried to preserve the native squoxes of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} while simultaneously curbing the incursion of the species into other ecologies. The group fears the invasive critters might irrevocably damage invaded ecosystems if left unchecked. Therefore, Xenowardens actively promote squox hunting on numerous worlds, as well as legal controls against importing the animals and releasing them into the wild.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Squox Pets</h2>\n<p>Squoxes are abundant across the Pact Worlds, breeding quickly and living for up to 10 years, or double that in captivity. Their intelligence and delightful appearance make them desirable companion animals, and they’re intelligent enough to be easily trained. Squoxes are also loyal, protective, charming, and entertaining, making them great companions for children. As clever and fun as they are, squoxes are also notorious for mischief, such as figuring out how to open cabinets and work simple machinery with the same aptitude as a very young sapient. They’ve even been known to clean up after themselves to hide thefts or accidents from their owners. Nevertheless, squoxes make great pets.<br><br>A squox kit can be purchased for 100 credits at 1 month old, just weaned from its mother. Untrained squoxes born as pets are usually domesticated and friendly but likely to misbehave without training. However, unscrupulous dealers gather squox kits in the wild and pass them off as domesticated, selling them at bargain prices. Squoxes reach adulthood by 10 months, and a fully trained adult squox goes for 400 credits.<br><br>A squox kit can be reared, or an older squox domesticated and trained, using the Survival skill, which takes 3 months. The squox’s inherent cleverness, curiosity, and friendliness grant its trainer a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to rear or train it. A domesticated squox is friendly or helpful toward its trainer and any owner who treats it well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\">Squox Gear</h2>\n<p>This item, known colloquially as a squox pocket, is available to PCs who want to protect their pets.

As consummate rabble-rousers, they inevitably cause trouble for the communities that receive them.<br><br>The cause for the stelezorn’s aggravating tendencies lies within their unusual diet: they feed on the wrathful emotions of sapient beings. Stelezorns have a strong attunement to such emotions, absorbing the anger and frustration of nearby creatures in much the same way that plants gain nutrients from sunlight. They feed on nearby creatures, usually making passive-aggressive remarks that frustrate people around them while avoiding physical confrontation until such altercations become inevitable. Most stelezorns maintain a broad and carefully cultivated social network to keep their feeding from overtaxing any one individual, a process they refer to as “tending the garden.”<br><br>In contrast to the creatures they provoke, stelezorns endeavor to maintain composure. They see themselves as masters of their own emotions and consider themselves to be better than anyone who falls prey to their manipulations.

Their control places them in either stoic calm or frothing rage, but their emotions rarely see any middle ground.

Each of these rarely encountered hunters has a muscular humanoid torso and stands nearly 8 feet tall on four jagged insectile legs. Tiny eyes ring a stormghost&rsquo;s conical head, which also bears a toothy mouth. Built of muscled flesh and hardened chitin, a stormghost weighs roughly 1,500 pounds.</p>\n<p>Triaxians who first encountered these creatures named them stormghosts because of their ability to conjure malignant weather and attack unseen. Though stormghosts inhabit many different locales, they often hunt their prey in remote mountainous areas, where they leap down on their victims from cliffsides or ambush them in blind mountain passes. These predators engage any target, posing a risk to not only the humanoids of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}, but also the dragons. While most stormghosts have tints with shades of blue, gray, and white, the pigments in their hide adapt to their surroundings; for example, stormghosts in the jungles of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} are mottled greens and browns.</p>\n<p>Exceptionally single-minded, stormghosts live to hunt and hate losing quarry, and they persistently pursue their fleeing prey, even forgoing rest. As with many efficient hunters, stormghosts&rsquo; senses and tenacity make them difficult to evade. These traits, in addition to their superior stamina, help them doggedly track down any prey that initially escape their attack. Only when another major predator begins hunting in the same region does a stormghost shift their attention from their original prey. Solitary creatures, stormghosts resist sharing their hunting grounds, especially with others of their kind.</p>\n<p>According to records kept by dragonriders of the Skyfire Mandate, fewer than 1,000 stormghosts have been spotted on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}. Multiple sightings of these rare creatures, made safely from the back of a dragonkin, seem to be of the same stormghost; many scholars estimate that the creatures have a smaller population than initially believed, with a few at most living in the Parapet Mountains. A naturalist in Preita recently published a journal detailing his journey in search for evidence of a stormghost, as tales of these creatures and other vicious beasts are fashionable in the cosmopolitan cities of the Allied Territories. In these writings, he postulates that stormghosts initially came from another world in the solar system, or perhaps beyond. In fact, while stormghosts first appeared on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus} long before the Gap, people in the Pact Worlds and even worlds in Near Space have since reported incidents that strongly indicate stormghost activity, suggesting that they&rsquo;ve since spread beyond their original planet&mdash;or that they didn&rsquo;t originate on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus} to begin with.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<section>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Solitary pups typically survive on a steady supply of smaller animals like squoxes (Starfinder Alien Archive&nbsp;2 118); pups from the same supenga brood commonly set off as a group, using their combined strength to take down much larger prey.</p>\n<p>Upon growing to about 15 feet in total length, a supenga&rsquo;s physical development slows considerably as it directs much of its energy toward reproduction. Known as titans, these mature adults produce as many as several hundred offspring over a century. In the Pact Worlds, supengas roam stretches of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the Fullbright wastes of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces}, but their largest population traverses the northern and western deserts of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s Colonies.</p>\n<h2>SUPENGA COMPANIONS</h2>\n<p>Although fierce, supengas raised from a young age with consistent care can form strong bonds.

			"description": "<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Surnochs are burrowing creatures that live in and devour the crusts of asteroids and small moons. Jaws that function like grinders and glands at the bases of their many spines that exude acid to liquefy rock allow these wormlike creatures to create labyrinthine tunnels in their domains, through which they can move with uncanny speed. The color of a surnoch’s hide is similar to that of the rock it burrows through. A typical surnoch is 15 feet long and weighs over 1,200 pounds.<br><br>At its leading end, a surnoch has a deep funnel of a mouth lined with numerous small orifices. At the back of the funnel is the grasping jaw with which it brings material into the funnel to be sorted. While the grasping jaw looks ferocious, the real danger of the maw lies in the fact that it is essentially a giant, churning mining machine.<br><br>The numerous small orifices that line the interior of a surnoch’s mouth allow matter of different consistencies to stream through as the creature chews and melts its way through rock and stone. Nutrientrich material is routed to the surnoch’s digestive tract, while much of the rest of it is broken down into various acids by the surnoch’s caustrolizer system, a series of organs unique to the creature that act like a chemical factory. A surnoch has an innate sense of which minerals its body requires the most of and has evolved a kind of X-ray vision that it allows it to find these foodstuffs, even through several feet of rock.<br><br>After consuming some of its favored elements, a surnoch excretes condensed and hardened forms of the minerals it can neither digest nor turn into acid. A feeding surnoch leaves tunnels full of strange alloys and amalgams in its wake, some which can’t be created through any other process. The castings that line a surnoch tunnel have an ethereal, shimmering beauty, like mother-of-pearl arranged in strange symmetries. Many of the endemic alloys are useful to the technological races of the Pact Worlds, so occasional expeditions purposefully seek out asteroids mined by surnochs to harvest the beasts’ unusual leavings. The greatest connoisseurs of these castings are the sarcesians, who turn the beautiful substances into jewelry and elaborate sculptures.<br><br>Approaching surnoch territory to harvest such material, or for any other reason, is incredibly dangerous. Surnochs aren’t territorial but they are ravenous. Almost any technology that can transport a visitor to a surnoch-infested asteroid contains the elements that a surnoch consumes. While powered armor and electronic items are the most likely to draw hungry surnochs, most refined material has a reasonable chance of looking like dinner. Those who make their livings harvesting surnoch castings primarily use equipment created from materials that have already been vetted as uninteresting to the creatures.<br><br>Surnochs are found mainly in the asteroids of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora} and in the larger rocks of the @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}n rings, fully sorting and digesting them before drifting through space to the next host. Surnochs are sometimes seen on small moons across the Pact Worlds, especially the shepherd moons of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}, and the discovery of surnoch remains on larger moons has given scientists a fairly precise understanding of how much gravity the beasts can withstand.<br><br>A surnoch reproduces once every decade or so, in a process where a smaller creature slowly grows from the surnoch’s hide over the course of a month. This parthenogenesis is often preceded by a period of gorging by the surnoch, which is difficult to differentiate from the creature’s normal voracious feeding behavior. A surnoch feasting in this manner tends to consume minerals with natural radiation (such as uranium), though rocky areas that have been bombarded with nuclear weapons also tend to draw a surnoch ready to reproduce. Once the creature’s bud fully sprouts, it detaches with a burst of acid and the newly formed surnoch is ready to begin feeding. Luckily for the galaxy, at least a third of surnoch parents immediately consume their offspring immediately following this “birth” for reasons that continue to baffle biologists to this day.<br><br>While most surnochs are solitary creatures, two will occasionally travel and feed together, often working their way through parallel tunnels to consume different minerals. While to outsiders it might seem like the two surnochs are deliberately working in concert to cause the most destruction, the truth is far less sinister. The two creatures have been brought together by unknown electromagnetic symbols echoing off their thick hides and attuning their appetites to crave distinct fare. And just as quickly as the pair came together, some mysterious trigger can set them against one another in a tumbling mass of spines and acid that is usually even more devastating than the two surnochs feeding peacefully. A handful of survivors from a recent surnoch attack on a Glimmerglass Inc. production facility in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora} claim that their factory was targeted by a rival company that placed a losing bid for the rights to their asteroid several years before. While their allegations have been dismissed as paranoid ravings, independent investigators found strange computer chips in the brain of what they believe is the corpse of the attacking surnoch.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Acid Lancer</h1>\n<p>In addition to collecting the valuable composites the creature leaves behind, some entrepreneurs enter surnochs’ territory to hunt and kill them for their acid-producing glands and spines. These components can be made into heavy weapons known as acid lancers, which shoot jets of caustic fluid. A wielder of an acid lancer can squeeze the gland located near the trigger to give her next shot an extra boost of damaging acid. Acid lancers use a special synthetic acid called caustrol for ammunition, which has the same price and comes in the same size containers as petrol.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any underground or vacuum (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{Diaspora})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Where the synapse worm stands out is in its unique feeding technique. The worm’s cranial cavity is lined with a membrane coated in an acidic and paralytic enzyme, which it can evert through its mouth in a thick effluvium that coats nearby surfaces with a branching, viscous web. This webbing can cause prey to enter a form of synaptic shock, thus giving the creature its name. The worm can then take nibbles of its prey without resistance—or in the case of smaller victims, such as spiders and insects, simply swallow them alive.<br><br>Synapse worms are opportunistic ambush predators with sharp-toothed maws and gullets strong enough to digest almost any organic substance. When hunting, a synapse worm burrows into the soil to wait for unsuspecting victims and then unleashes its paralytic webbing. If it wounds its prey enough to prevent the creature’s escape and the creature is too large to swallow whole, the worm then buries the victim alive to feast on later. Those unlucky enough to find a synapse worm’s hunting grounds regularly stumble across the rotting remains of those who previously fell to the vermin.<br><br>A synapse worm typically grows to about 3 to 4 feet long, and can raise itself up on its back half to stand a little over 2 feet tall. Its nearly nonexistent appendages are useless in combat, but they do allow it to move through soil. Synapse worms’ permeable skin naturally absorbs pigments from their surroundings, allowing a worm to blend quite well into its normal habitat. In a sterile environment, a synapse worm is a bright-blue color, with a cyan belly and webbing material that is white or, more rarely, reddish orange.<br><br>While no one is certain where synapse worms originated, these creatures can be found on a wide range of worlds throughout Near Space and the Vast. Luckily, no synapse worms have ever been seen in the wilds of the Pact Worlds, but a couple of eccentric collectors keep one or two of these vermin in their menageries.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any warm or temperate</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or clew (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"name": "Tekenki",
			"description": "<p>Tekenkis are outliers among the massive hulks known collectively as colossi or kaiju. Most such horrors are organic in nature, but tekenkis are mechanical. Plates of magic-infused alloys etched with bizarre patterns cover their bodies. Atop this hulk are plasma cannons that draw power from the tekenki’s internal fusion, fueled by whatever material the monster occasionally consumes. A tekenki also carries a reserve of eldritch energy that allows the creature to neutralize technology, plunging the region around the creature into disarray when technology stops working.<br><br>These rare colossi are found across the galaxy. Some people believe tekenkis came from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko}, but the truth remains unknown. On @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko}, numerous colossi rose from the planet’s evaporated oceans 200 years ago during a cataclysm called the Awakening. Tekenkis rampage across that planet today, using their uncanny abilities to sense population centers and wreak havoc on embattled survivors, most of whom have huddled underground since the colossi arose. However, tekenkis are more likely to battle the far less rare kyokors and other colossi. Such a clash is as devastating to the area in which it occurs as it is to either titanic monster.<br><br>The fact that tekenkis appeared after the initial Awakening and regularly seek battle with other colossi has led some to suspect they came from elsewhere. Studies have also shown that tekenkis are capable of technological spaceflight, although none have been observed doing so, and few ever fly at all except in what resembles an extended leap. Perhaps they sensed the Awakening and came to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko} in response. Maybe they were always on the planet, an ancient check to the primal horror the colossi represent. Some among @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko's} people, the damai, seek the origins of the tekenkis, hoping to turn the mechanical beasts into allies in the fight to retake @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko} from the colossi.<br><br>Whatever their origin, there is little chance that tekenkis are naturally occurring. Those who have studied these hulks have determined that tekenkis have internal engineering similar to pre-Gap machinery, although their space-related tech seems more recent. Daimalkan legends, which also speak of the slumbering creatures that eventually awakened to destroy the planet, told of masters who-in their hubris- wished to control @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko's} technology. Although these tales were never tied to the colossi, some lore experts and scientists have wondered if an ancient Daimalkan cabal is responsible for creating tekenkis and programming them to adapt to their circumstances. A fringe few believe that these lost masters were behind the creation of all Daimalkan colossi.<br><br>In the first decades after the Awakening, the damai hardly differentiated between the enormous horrors that devastated their civilizations. However, after 50 years, leaders who became known as the Guardians discovered mystical, rune-scribed orbs deep underground. The Guardians used these artifacts, which convey information about colossi to users, and the empathic bonds the orbs created among the Guardians to keep their people safe from the rampaging colossi. As their settlements became more stable and a few Guardians ushered some damai back aboveground, scholars studied the colossi. Some brave souls mounted expeditions into the blasted wilderness, while other colonies sent strike teams against colossi. These brave souls took note of two tekenki qualities: First, the Guardian orbs convey no data about the mechanical colossi. Second, tekenkis can neutralize technology with electromagnetic blasts. Damai have yet to create a reliable way to fight tekenkis, so a tekenki sighting can drive inhabitants of a surface colony belowground again.<br><br>@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko} was never a hub of interstellar activity, but after the Awakening, colossi hunters and scientists ventured to the planet in droves. Some tried to extract colossi to study for noble purposes, but others have sought to study and then replicate the beasts for their own ends. A few groups determined to learn more about these monstrosities succeeded in disabling and spiriting away dormant colossi. Tragically, more than one of these creatures, including a few tekenkis, reanimated on the destination worlds and destroyed the facilities that held them. Such monsters still rampage across their new homes. Wherever tekenkis and other colossi are found away from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko}, the remains of an ill-fated experimental facility are somewhere nearby. Finding a tekenki on another world without such a link to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.G8uKED7AXY0If3U8]{Daimalko} could lend credence to the theory that they come from elsewhere and, possibly, point the way to their origins.<br><br>A typical tekenki is 60 feet tall and 150 feet long and weighs 250 tons.</p>"

		"Tekhoinos": {
			"name": "Tekhoinos",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>The enigmatic aeons maintain balance in the multiverse according to rules known only to themselves. Each variety of aeon holds sway over an aspect of the natural order and seeks to maintain equilibrium, indifferent to any concerns of ethics or morality. Tekhoinos aeons concern themselves with the balance between social development and technological advancement. Populations whose scientific advancements have outstripped their social development are likely to draw a tekhoinos’s attention, as are those who forcefully suppress technological development in favor of spiritual concerns.<br/><br/>Tekhoinos often become involved when a society is uplifted or held back by outside forces, but they also step in when a society manages to unbalance itself. Exactly what constitutes a society out of balance is determined by an intricate code unfathomable to any but the aeons. When an imbalance is suspected, a single tekhoinos visits the society, gathers intelligence with its innate powers, and then confers with a larger collective of tekhoinos and other aeons via its envisaging ability. Once a consensus is reached, the tekhoinos can begin its intervention, wait for reinforcements, or move on to seek out more imbalanced civilizations.<br/><br/>Technological excess that would draw a tekhoinos’s attention might include any less-advanced species that stumbles across advanced technology or species that invent technologies that their societies lack the cultural maturity to handle. On the other end of the spectrum, societies that eschew technology to the extent that harm is done to their societal development might attract tekhoinos, which then seek to inspire new inventions or disrupt the social constructs that keep technological innovation at bay. Tekhoinos prefer covert actions such as manipulation and sabotage to direct confrontation, but this preference is not out of a desire to protect the recipients of their intervention-the aeons have merely found that subtlety makes for more lasting change. This clandestine approach also does not mean the aeons’ actions are benign. A collective might rectify an imbalance through covert manipulation of key individuals or targeted assassinations, or they might take more drastic measures, such as detonating a starship’s reactor or instigating a war, all based on cold calculations regarding which actions give the highest probability of long-term success.<br/><br/>Tekhoinos take great pains to hide their presence, lest notice of their tampering lead to further imbalance. They spend most of their time invisible, and they move carefully and deliberately to further evade detection. They prefer to incapacitate those who discover them, but they don’t hesitate to dispose of creatures that prove a threat to their aims.<br/><br/>Tekhoinos normally intervene in the affairs of single planets, isolated communities, or remote outposts since sprawling planetary and interplanetary populations more readily resist change and are more likely to uncover tekhoinos’s manipulations. However, when major populations swing so far out of balance that they can’t be ignored, they warrant intervention by multiple tekhoinos collectives. Such grand interventions can require generations of covert observation and manipulation before massive, coordinated action, all overseen by elder aeons of significantly greater capabilities.<br/><br/>Such major actions might be subtle. However, if the threat of the imbalance is widespread but its source centralized, or if swift action is required, the intervention could resemble an invasion. The tekhoinos collectives assigned to the intervention might take direct control of problematic sites or objects. Forced into such action, the aeons then directly confront any defenders of those problem areas.<br/><br/>A tekhoinos has no eyes, instead perceiving with its entire body. Three tentacle-like limbs revolve around a tekhoinos’s nebulous core, and the substance of each limb shifts constantly. Across the aeon’s body, patterns of crystalline circuitry and iridescent vapor form, propagate, and give way, the same structure never repeating. The typical tekhoinos measures 4 feet across but weighs only a few pounds.<br/><br/>Like all their kin, tekhoinos communicate using mental imagery rather than words. Among their own kind, they can share the full range of experience and emotion via these images, but communication with non-aeons is far more limited. However, as caretakers of civilization, tekhoinos have better insight into the minds of other creatures than typical aeons have. They can make full use of their telepathic images to communicate with other creatures even when such interactions would normally require a shared language.<br/><br/>Adaptive Defense Module Armor Upgrades<br/><br/>Despite their secrecy, tekhoinos have been identified as the corrective force behind more than one newly stabilized society, and they have even been celebrated for their role. One civilization on a lonely planet in Near Space had great mastery over magic and technology, but its people had long turned a blind eye to the great suffering they caused one another. After a tekhoinos intervened and ushered in an era of peace and prosperity, these people designed an armor upgrade meant to honor their benefactor.<br/><br/>Extra Content<br/><br/>The following extra content was found for this creature:<br/><br/>- Aeon (Summoning) Graft Template<br/><br/>- Aeon (Creature Subtype) Graft Template</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Outer Planes)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or collective (3-10)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

A dissolver’s main mode of attack is actually hidden between its mandibles: two vascular conduits pump highly corrosive and combustible chemicals from within separate glands in the dissolver’s abdomen. These chemicals are inert when separate but explode when combined, in a conflagration of acid and fire. Like many other Swarm components, a dissolver bears a set of insectile wings, but they aren’t powerful enough for the massive, heavy creature to fly.<br><br>Swarm xersks are a rare sight, and in fact only a handful have been seen by members of other species who lived to spread news of their existence. These creatures rarely resort to physical attacks, instead relying on their potent psychic abilities to mentally assault and frighten intelligent creatures.<br><br>These bizarre Swarm components have large, crested heads covered in a horrifying array of staring eyes. Those who look into a xersk’s eyes for even a few seconds begin to question reality, and may eventually lose their hold on it altogether.<br><br>Superficially, xersks appear to exhibit more free will than most Swarm components.

A mix of several types of molten stone and metal found on their native planet make up thermatrods&rsquo; torsos, allowing them to digest heavy minerals inedible to most living creatures. Several interlocking raised hexagonal plates resembling basalt columns make up their cooler backside. Due to this composition, a typical thermatrod stands 10 feet tall and weighs several tons.</p>\n<p>Many mystics believe that the worlds thermatrods inhabit must also have connections to the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire&mdash;thin spots where the energies of those places bleed through into the Material Plane. After much study by dedicated xenobiologists, however, current wisdom maintains that though the creatures might strongly resemble the elemental inhabitants of those planes, they&rsquo;re simply silicon-based beasts that thrive in extreme heat.</p>\n<p>Like some other silicon-based life-forms, thermatrods&rsquo; chemical evolution didn&rsquo;t result in traditional sensory organs such as eyes and ears. However, fine crystalline matrices within the stone of a thermatrod&rsquo;s head allow it to sense even very fine tremors. The one typical sense organ it does have is its dripping maw, into which the beast crams loose stones for sustenance.</p>\n<p>Pact Worlds scientists don&rsquo;t yet fully understand how a thermatrod&rsquo;s silicon core maintains its intense heat. Some believe that, like a planet, it must contain radioactive elements that decay to generate this energy. The fact that thermatrods appear more prevalent in warm areas that contain a larger percentage of naturally radioactive metals supports this theory, but some question why the creatures themselves aren&rsquo;t radioactive. Other xenobiologists posit that thermatrods might contain fragments of Hellfire that never cease burning, but no one has proven this hypothesis.</p>\n<p>Thermatrods&rsquo; method of reproduction adds to the mystery of their biology. They travel to a hot geographical location, such as volcano or a thermal spring, to undergo a kind of mitosis. A thermatrod&rsquo;s torso cracks open before spilling forth a portion of its molten core onto the ground. The exterior of this blob cools into the general shape of another thermatrod, which instinctively seeks out stone and metals to consume. If the surrounding area has an appropriate amount of sustenance, the newborn thermatrod grows to standard size within hours. Otherwise, the creature dies, leaving nothing behind but a strangely shaped rock, for which some collectors pay handsomely. In either case, the original thermatrod moves on long before the new one finishes developing.</p>\n<p>On rare occasions, a severe disturbance in a planet&rsquo;s magnetic field can cause two thermatrods in the same place to completely expel their cores, forming a single new mass. This pile hardens into a huge, four-armed thermatrod that devours any and all nearby metal-laced stones and crystals. Known as a thermatrod caldera, this creature constantly seeks out more materials to consume, its burning appetite for ore almost impossible to sate. Unfortunate mining operations that happen to be in the same area as a caldera&rsquo;s feeding grounds usually get torn apart by the ravenous beast, often killing any workers caught in the way, as well as causing hundreds of thousands of credits worth in damages and lost profits. As such, mining companies that operate in areas of known thermatrod activity often spend extra resources on defensive barriers and equip their security with cryo weapons. Otherwise, these corporations must rely on freelancers to travel to an overrun mine and deal with any rampaging behemoths, which can often run up an even steeper bill.</p>\n<h2>MAGMA SLEDGE</h2>\n<p>Inspired by the red-hot stony body of a thermatrod, magma sledges are the larger cousins of the more agile magma blades (Starfinder Armory 38). At first glance, a magma sledge seems like an analog weapon with a steel shaft and a head of solid stone. However, when the weapon powers on, cracks form along the surface show the magma hidden within, held in place with powerful magnetic fields. When slammed into a target, the intense heat and force can send even the most powerful opponents reeling. Factory floors that mass produce magma sledges are often swelteringly hot.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 99.1279%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8823%;\">FLAME</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.93741%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">LEVEL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.4037%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">PRICE</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.3033%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">DAMAGE</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5715%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">CRITICAL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.31671%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">BULK</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.1187%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">SPECIAL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8823%;\">Magma sledge, rhyolite</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.93741%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.4037%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">3,100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.3033%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">1d10 B &amp; F</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5715%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.31671%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.1187%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Powered (capacity 20, usage 2), reach, unweildy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8823%;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Magma sledge, andesite</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.93741%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.4037%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">13,800</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.3033%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">3d10 B &amp; F</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5715%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">@Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered}</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.31671%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.1187%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Powered (capacity 40, usage 2), reach, unweildy</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8823%;\">Magma sledge, basalt</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.93741%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.4037%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">112,000</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.3033%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">7d10 B &amp; F</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5715%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.31671%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.1187%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Powered (capacity 40, usage 2), reach, unweildy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8823%;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Magma sledge, plagioclase</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.93741%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.4037%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">850,000</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.3033%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">12d10 B &amp; F</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5715%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">@Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered}</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.31671%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.1187%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Powered (capacity 80, usage 2), reach, unweildy</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

On worlds with low amounts of tectonic movement and consistent volcanic activity, such bacteria can grow over the course of millennia, joining together into larger and larger forms. Eventually, these creatures gain enough cohesion to leave their fiery, corrosive homes, driven by a hunger for organic prey. With their amorphous bodies and immunity to fire and acid, thermophilic oozes have almost limitless access to places other creatures dare not tread, giving them zones of safety from which they can hunt. Thermophilic oozes can consume and gain sustenance from any organic matter, but many of them seem to prefer to chase down living creatures over immobile plants.<br><br>In addition to providing a safe haven, a thermophilic ooze’s warm and corrosive home environments are necessary to the creature’s long-term survival. When deprived of the acidity and heat of their homes for an extended period of time, the creatures need to eat more and more with each passing day. This makes them more aggressive when encountered outside of their native environments-such as those that hitch an unintended ride on an excavator or deep-sea submarine.<br><br>Thermophilic oozes are a particular nuisance near the planet Ilemchuuva’s underwater volcanic vents and mining sites. Local bolidas take great pleasure in exterminating them en masse, considering them to be a form of dangerous vermin.

Cooler, stony plates form on these segments, with hot flesh between them, to protect the thoqqua. A similar material, rigid but superheated due to the worm’s internal fire, makes a pointed “beak” the thoqqua uses to burrow and attack. Although outsiders such as thoqquas don’t need to eat, thoqquas consume minerals as they burrow, adding these elements to their rocky shells. A thoqqua unable to do so eventually loses a portion of its natural armor (reducing its KAC slightly). Most adult thoqquas are 5 feet long and weigh 200 pounds.

		"Thorgothrel": {
			"name": "Thorgothrel",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The aggressive and insightful genetic manipulators known as thorgothrels enforce their vision of retrogressive development on other species. Once an enlightened humanoid society with impressive technological advancements, the thorgothrels fell under the sway of philosophers and zealots who believed that evolution into higher-ordered forms posed a danger to the universe. The thorgothrels thus began millennia-long self-experimentation to revert themselves to simple, protoplasmic forms while retaining their keen intelligence. About the same time as their society succeeded in this goal, they developed space travel and brought their crusade into the rest of the galaxy. Thorgothrels are now determined to repair the “evolutionary errors” that infest all of existence.<br><br>Thorgothrels can apply their mastery of biology and genetic sciences to new creatures they meet after only a few minutes of observation. Despite the medical advances their knowledge might herald for others, most thorgothrels consider regression to a biologically primitive state the only type of genetic manipulation worth performing. They cause this deterioration with startling speed, excreting a complex series of chemicals from their pseudopods that quickly break down a victim’s genetic structure. Their victims’ brains devolve, which suits the thorgothrels fine, as they prefer to have their intellects alone design the fates of living things. Although many thorgothrels prefer to inflict this condition with gentle touches of their pseudopods in controlled laboratory settings, more fanatical thorgothrels deploy this genetic regression in combat. Both are considered appropriate and even laudatory methods in thorgothrel society. Although thorgothrels insist their vision of devolution is appropriate for all living things- intelligent and unintelligent alike-they derive the most satisfaction from genetic regression of intelligent creatures. Unfortunate prisoner-patients who suffer thorgothrel ministrations over weeks or months are inevitably transformed into near-feral beasts that harm themselves in attempts to escape. Thorgothrels consider each lost patient a mere stepping-stone on the long road to devolution of the universe and simply move on to the next experiment.<br><br>Thorgothrels are frequently repulsed by the diversity of intelligent life they meet. They preach that humanoids, in particular, bear dangerously hyper-specialized organs and would be better served with a homogeneous form. Thorgothrels therefore rarely interact peacefully with humanoid societies, instead massing in large numbers to reduce entire planetary populations to mindless, atavistic beasts. Thorgothrels might initially get along well with other intelligent amorphous or ooze races, such as the selamids, but thorgothrels are inevitably disappointed when members of these races won’t join the fight to “improve” other life-forms throughout the universe.<br><br>For all their preaching of genetic superiority, thorgothrels face incredible physical limitations when away from their home world of Gothra. Blobs of protoplasm 12 feet in diameter and only a few inches thick, thorgothrels have no other means of locomotion other than to undulate slowly and awkwardly along the ground. Nearly all atmospheres other than Gothra’s cause thorgothrels’ bodies to evaporate painfully in mere minutes. To overcome these limitations, the thorgothrels again turned to technology. Each thorgothrel wraps itself around an armature of silvery metal, allowing it to stand upright and walk by contracting its form around the armature. As the thorgothrel numerical system is ternary, most armatures have three, six, or nine appendages, although the precise number is based on each thorgothrel’s personal preference. Thorgothrels are translucent, so their strange armatures are visible deep within their upright, undulating forms.<br><br>To protect their fragile forms from sublimation- and to shield themselves from the hostility of those who oppose their mandate to reforge all higher-ordered life-thorgothrels imbue their armatures with sophisticated force field generators. Thorgothrels have fine control over the energy modulated by their force fields, and they can both launch blasts of this energy at foes and recharge it with their own internal electrical reserves. The armature’s metal not only supports and protects a thorgothrel, but nourishes it. Each armature carries low-grade electrical charges that thorgothrels feed on. These charges also quicken a thorgothrel’s intellect, enabling rapid processing of sensory stimuli. Most thorgothrels become exceedingly possessive of their armatures, marking them with symbols to indicate personal scientific successes and victories that advance their crusade.<br><br>Although these silvery, metallic armatures are the most common technological solutions thorgothrels employ, more inventive or influential thorgothrels sometimes rely on alternative devices, such as enormous walking machines, reticulated gliders, or even strange devices that translate thought into physical form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Gothra)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or symposium (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Though also gifted with teeth and claws, these hunters’ most identifiable feature is a mane of glass-like fibers they use to gore prey and shred undergrowth. While predominantly carnivores, threshwolves also feed on fruit, vegetation, and fungus when available. When a pack claims territory, they spend time carving a labyrinthine den within the thick, thorny undergrowth they favor. They raise their young communally, with the largest female taking the lead in most hunts. Packs develop complex social hierarchies and delineate labor much like ant colonies or formians, with different members focused on hunting, patrolling territory, maintaining the lair, or rearing young.<br><br>Social behavior and reasonable animal intelligence make threshwolves easy to train, though the aggressive predators will constantly test the resolve of their trainers with challenges for dominance. Vesk colonies in the Vast have experimented with truly domesticating the alien beasts, yielding mixed results. Threshwolves can be bred for obedience, and the same genes that control this behavior seem linked to their iconic mane; more approachable and malleable threshwolves develop finer quills that cause minor irritation rather than lacerations.<br><br>Xenobiologists have determined that threshwolves originate from the same world as needlehawks (page 58), and the two likely shared biomes. Many believe needlehawks would scavenge what they could from threshwolf kills, provided that the small fliers could stay away from these larger predators’ jaws.

			"name": "Time Dimensional",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Time dimensionals are living fragments of the Dimension of Time, the mysterious demiplane that seems to act as the focal point for the entire flow of time throughout existence. These creatures are seemingly created whenever an event or individual threatens the nature of causality or the flow of time. Time dimensionals act as corrective agents on behalf of the dimension, confronting and neutralizing threats to the timestream. This action can take a variety of forms, ranging from the destruction of the offending target to altering the memories and motives of specific individuals to delaying events until the self-correcting power of time can resolve any discrepancies. In situations of great disruption, the Dimension of Time will dispatch several dimensionals at once to work in conjunction to preserve the timestream.<br><br>Due to the fragile nature of causality, the Dimension of Time creates time dimensionals in only the most necessary scenarios. The dimension’s discretion confounds scholars as the situations that require a time dimensional’s presence seem inconsistent. Some seemingly mundane circumstances, such as the uneventful passage of a Vercite transport through @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} in 303 ag, have caused the appearance of a time dimensional. Meanwhile, events that seem like an obvious beacon for time dimensionals, like the Veskarium research vessel that used a black hole to alter its relative time flow to quickly advance weapons technology in 296 ag, garnered no attention from the creatures whatsoever.<br><br>The appearance of a time dimensional varies between each noted sighting and from dimensional to dimensional. The most common appearance is that of a lanky humanoid approximately 12 feet tall formed from myriad crystal facets. Other times, the crystal appears smoother, taking on the appearance of polished glass, while sometimes the shape is wholly translucent. Regardless of a time dimensional’s shape, images of events throughout time, including past, present, and possible future events, constantly flicker within the creature’s body.<br><br>Time dimensionals share a portion of the powers of the Dimension of Time and are capable of manipulating the flow of time in a localized area. This allows a time dimensional to lock a creature out of time’s progression or advance the flow of time on an item so quickly that it crumbles to dust. Additionally, this ability grants a time dimensional superior control over its temporal position, allowing it to move around a battlefield in the blink of an eye. This free access to the flow of time also allows a time dimensional to tap into its own past and future knowledge at any time.<br><br>Scholars’ fascination with both the Dimension of Time and its native creatures has led several theories throughout history. Some say the existence of time dimensionals in the first place implies a measure of inherent sapience to the Dimension of Time, as few other planes would be capable of creating such creatures, let alone dispatching them with such precision. A few esoteric sages believe that, despite the differing appearance of some dimensionals, only a single time dimensional exists: a creature whose form becomes smoother as its existence progresses, perhaps due to constant creation and reabsorption of the creature by the Dimension of Time. If true, this lone dimensional must be crossing and recrossing its own temporal path, meeting later or earlier incarnations of itself and working in tandem with them to enact the dimension’s will.<br><br>Beyond collecting small amounts of temporal residue left behind by destroyed time dimensionals, any attempt to access the power of time dimensionals is futile. Researchers who have attempted to use time travel to return to lost Golarion or other notable points throughout history have vanished entirely or, as rumors persist, encountered an exceptionally rare and powerful time dimensional that removed the individual from time entirely, erasing any evidence of the victim’s existence. Skeptics are quick to point out that even if such a thing occurred, no one would actually know about it. Even if a chronal scientist doesn’t draw the ire of the Dimension of Time, they run the risk of attracting a hound of Tindalos, a terrifying danger in its own right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Dimension of Time)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or chronology (3-12)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Called vulkariki in Lashunta, squoxes gained their popular moniker from humans who thought the creatures resembled a cross between a fox and a squirrel, with useful qualities from both animals. Squoxes are furry, vulpine animals roughly 2 feet in length and weighing around 15 pounds. They are quadrupedal, with five-fingered prehensile paws that have rotating wrists and ankles, allowing them to climb down surfaces headfirst like a squirrel. The creature’s other features are fox-like, including a flattened head with triangular ears, a pointed snout, and a bushy tail. Squox fur can come in hues of red orange, gray, fulvous, white, or brown, with white on the belly, neck, and tail tip. The species also has an array of fur patterns and environmental adaptations, such as long ears that allow desert-dwelling squoxes to disperse heat and thick seasonal fur and coloration for those accustomed to arctic regions.<br><br>Squoxes are among the most intelligent animal species in the Pact Worlds, exhibiting social behaviors and hierarchies along with a vast vocal repertoire. When confronted, squoxes are devious tacticians, especially in groups. They are clever enough to poke eyes, bite sensitive regions, and steal objects to bait enemies away from a den.<br><br>Although they originated on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, squoxes gained popularity across the Pact Worlds for their adorable features and ability to adapt to new environments. The people of Asana happily exported squoxes, which lashuntas see as pests. Over centuries, squoxes spread and successfully adjusted to biomes across the Pact Worlds. They’ve even begun to appear in the wild in the Veskarium and worlds in the Vast.<br><br>Xenowardens have tried to preserve the native squoxes of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} while simultaneously curbing the incursion of the species into other ecologies. The group fears the invasive critters might irrevocably damage invaded ecosystems if left unchecked. Therefore, Xenowardens actively promote squox hunting on numerous worlds, as well as legal controls against importing the animals and releasing them into the wild.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Squox Pets</h2>\n<p>Squoxes are abundant across the Pact Worlds, breeding quickly and living for up to 10 years, or double that in captivity. Their intelligence and delightful appearance make them desirable companion animals, and they’re intelligent enough to be easily trained. Squoxes are also loyal, protective, charming, and entertaining, making them great companions for children. As clever and fun as they are, squoxes are also notorious for mischief, such as figuring out how to open cabinets and work simple machinery with the same aptitude as a very young sapient. They’ve even been known to clean up after themselves to hide thefts or accidents from their owners. Nevertheless, squoxes make great pets.<br><br>A squox kit can be purchased for 100 credits at 1 month old, just weaned from its mother. Untrained squoxes born as pets are usually domesticated and friendly but likely to misbehave without training. However, unscrupulous dealers gather squox kits in the wild and pass them off as domesticated, selling them at bargain prices. Squoxes reach adulthood by 10 months, and a fully trained adult squox goes for 400 credits.<br><br>A squox kit can be reared, or an older squox domesticated and trained, using the Survival skill, which takes 3 months. The squox’s inherent cleverness, curiosity, and friendliness grant its trainer a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to rear or train it. A domesticated squox is friendly or helpful toward its trainer and any owner who treats it well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\">Squox Gear</h2>\n<p>This item, known colloquially as a squox pocket, is available to PCs who want to protect their pets.

It won’t follow a command that would bring significant harm to itself, but it has your interests at heart and does what it can to aid you. While your squox companion is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Perception checks to notice and search when the GM determines your squox could help you accomplish these tasks.<br><br>Your Tiny squox companion can share your space and end its movement there. Outside your space, your squox has evasion, as the operative class feature. While in your space, your squox has evasion, improved evasion (as the operative exploit), and cover. In addition, when your squox is adjacent to you or in your space and would take damage, you can use your reaction to intercede and take the damage instead.<br><br>In addition, your adorable companion is distracting. While it is in your space, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Bluff checks to feint. If your squox is in your space or within 10 feet of you, you can instead gain this insight bonus to Bluff checks to create a diversion, which can allow you or your squox to attempt to hide (your choice of which when you attempt the Bluff check).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or skulk (3-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

		"Tripod": {
			"name": "Tripod",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Tripods are the product of a long-extinct species of warmongers who dwelled upon a distant, unknown world in the Vast. Those creators are long gone, but their legacy endures in these devastating and malevolent war machines. After plying the Void for countless years while hibernating in cylinders of starmetal alloy, tripods sometimes crash into a planet. They are often discovered this way, buried at the centers of craters that formed during their initial arrival on those worlds. The machines remain dormant for centuries before awakening either when disturbed or according to a preset trigger, at which point they stride forth to bring destruction upon the planet.<br><br>A tripod is an immense creature more than 50 feet tall. Striding on three articulated legs and attacking with long, mechanical tentacles, tripods also fight with devastating disintegrator weapons and infamous grenades of corrosive gas. Instead of computer consoles and electronic power sources, each tripod is powered and controlled by an immortal mass of adaptive nanotechnology. This fluid mass of tiny machines makes up everything about the construct that is changeable, including powering its weapons. This collective is said to be the part of the tripod that can be contacted and reasoned with. All tripods refer to themselves as collective entities, using “we” for self‑reference.<br><br>Some scholars speculate that the form and nature of tripods are reffections of those of their mysterious progenitors, although little remains to indicate what this mysterious species was like when they were active on their home world. Ancient legends speak of a time when this species unleashed an army of tripods upon other worlds, using immense devices to launch them in their hibernation tubes across interplanetary gulfs. Certainly the fact that tripods can be encountered on all manner of planets across the galaxy is a sign of the malice of their creators. What finally brought this species to an end and left their tripods abandoned across the galaxy is unknown.<br><br>Tripods possess a cruel and sadistic intelligence, perhaps as an intentional feature. Waging war brings a sense of purpose to the tripod. Each tripod gives loud intermittent shrieking calls, like the screech of metal grinding on metal. If one hears the call of another, the constructs gather together. They form groups and spread destruction for no apparent purpose other than to cause ruin.<br><br>Tripods are especially responsive to electronic communication. The anacites of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon} used this fact to their advantage, turning three rampaging tripods from enemies to allies, and those war machines still stride @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}. Each acts as a freelance hunter of outlaws and participates in larger battles at the Midnight Trenches. The anacites can influence the tripods, but the war constructs overall do as they will, acquiescing only to the anacite directive to stay outside the cities of the First Ones. Despite this command, the tripods of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon} have harassed the khizars of Constant, keeping the plantlike people and the bizarre vegetation in check outside the city’s perimeter.<br><br>Other species have studied defeated tripods and used this knowledge, along with harvested technology, to build facsimiles of the colossal constructs. The appearance of these new tripods can vary, but they have their signature array of three agile legs, grasping tentacles, and nanotech inner workings. Even these recently created tripods tend to be wicked and warlike. It’s as if some facet of the ancient technology that allows for their creation infects them with the will to wage war.<br><br>Tripods as Vehicles<br><br>A tripod has an internal compartment and can be used as a Gargantuan vehicle in vehicle combat or vehicle chases. In such cases, it acts as its own pilot, although its passengers might be able to direct or influence it. It has the following additional statistics: item level equal to its CR; drive speed 60 ft., full speed 500 ft., overland speed 60 mph; collision damage 12d10 B (DC 17)-a tripod’s legs deal damage like a Large vehicle, but they’re also easier to avoid; reduce collision damage the tripod takes by 20; -4 attack roll penalty (-6 at full speed). A tripod acting as a vehicle can carry up to 3 Medium passengers and provides them total cover.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or platoon (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Some xenobiologists speculate that the patterns an umbracygot creates within the territory it inhabits indicate the creature’s mood or even their psychic impressions on the cosmos.

			"description": "<section>\n<h2>Undead Minion</h2>\n<p>The most commonly encountered undead in the galaxy are the mindless minions of greater undead (such as necrovites and vampires) or of powerful spellcasters (including both mystics and technomancers of all races). As creatures with no motivations of their own, undead minions can also be found leaderless in the remains of ruined structures on planetary surfaces, adrift in derelict spacecraft, and even floating through the void of space. Whether encountered as servants of a mastermind who coordinates their movements or as a mindless threat in the wake of a cataclysmic disaster, undead minions are always a force to be reckoned with and a scourge to the living.<br><br>Though there are countless types of mindless undead who serve as minions, the most common are cybernetic zombies, occult zombies, and skeletal undead. Both occult zombies and skeletal undead are animated by magical or supernatural forces and created either in dark necromantic rituals (including the&nbsp;create undead&nbsp;spell) or by strange and mysterious reactions between the Material and Negative Energy Planes. Cybernetic zombies, on the other hand, arise as the result of technological implants that continue to function after their hosts have died, causing the body to act in a sad, shambling imitation of real life. Without control from an external force, these three kinds of undead simply go through the motions of their former lives, without reason, purpose, or the promise of an end to their miserable existences.<br><br>In the Pact Worlds, most undead hail from the dead world of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox} and were created by the bone sages, though zombies and skeletal creatures are also found among the wreckage of ancient battlefields on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the enigmatic, alien structures on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Ave5caJSxVvKFVAB]{Aucturn}.

			"name": "Urog",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Dykon, one of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda}’s numerous moons, is legendary for its entirely silicon-based ecosystem. While many carbon-based life-forms from other Pact Worlds have since settled there, mining valuable crystals and hunting the silicon predators for their biologically produced superconductors, the world’s crystalline forests and faceted plateaus have also produced their own intelligent races, most notably the famed urogs.<br/><br/>Urog anatomy can be deceptive. When encountered in their everyday or “traveling mode,” they almost resemble crystalline slugs or snails, their shimmering shell-scales hanging down almost to the ground and hiding their limbs as they float along like hovercrafts on a thin cushion of electromagnetism produced by microscopic cilia. It’s only when they’re in “engagement mode”-whether that means mating, fighting, or interacting directly with other races or their environment-that they rear up and unfold their multiple sets of articulated limbs. While every urog has a powerful beak adorning its head-stalk, this is used solely for fighting and reproduction. Food consumption actually occurs underneath an urog, as it uses the localized electromagnetic effects of its cilia to gradually break molecular bonds and tear tiny pieces off whatever it’s consuming. These “bites” are so microscopic that it’s often hard for other races to even tell what’s happening, with the item in question simply eroding steadily without any obvious markings. Though this allows urogs to eat nearly anything, breaking off and absorbing only the molecules they need and leaving aside the ones they don’t, they prefer the silicon-based plant life of their home. This peculiar method of absorbing nutrients also makes them nearly impossible to poison or @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drug}, as their bodies simply discard any unnecessary ingested molecules.<br/><br/>With plenty of options for food and few predators thanks to their size and sturdy frames, urogs are free to spend most of their time in contemplation. Constantly inspired by the complex geometry of their crystalline world, they wander seemingly at random across the moon’s surface, alone or in loose coalitions, working on mathematical problems or conducting enigmatic experiments. Their languid pace belies their exceedingly sharp intellect; indeed, it is likely because of their laser-like focus on unlocking the galaxy’s most esoteric mathematical and scientific secrets that they can be somewhat slow to react to external stimuli.<br/><br/>Urogs often become single minded in finding the most efficient solution to a problem, spending untold hours just to shave seconds off a given process. This reputation for exactitude has made the crystalline creatures sought-after astrogators, consultants, engineers, and scientists in the Pact Worlds, though most members of other races who work with them acknowledge that such relationships can be challenging, to put it mildly. Though largely friendly- at least by their own standards-urogs are creatures with little appreciation for social niceties. A bored urog will think nothing of tuning out the person speaking to them or even wandering away entirely, regardless of how powerful the speaker may be, or how potentially life-threatening the matter they’re discussing. Even those who do prove themselves worthy of an urog’s attention must still deal with its brusque personality. Urog emotions are difficult for most other creatures to understand, and resolve primarily around the satisfaction of solving a problem, disappointment at failure, or the excitement of a promising line of inquiry. As such, urogs readily point out mistakes, whether their own or others’. While this is in the interest of improving performance and achieving better results, few humans have the patience and poise to graciously accept an enthusiastic urog’s stream of constant criticism.<br/><br/>Urogs who choose lives of adventure often do so because they believe mathematical and scientific secrets hide in pockets of the galaxy that simply can’t be observed from their limited vantage point on a small moon-and often because they distrust the rigor of the scholarship produced by other species. Urogs who leave Dykon for long periods sometimes suffer an attenuation of their race’s special abilities, likely due to their changed diet and lack of certain electrical fields normally provided by the moon itself. Most successful spacefaring urogs eventually see the value in assisting their less deliberate companions, and they make excellent engineers and science officers on ships that have enough room for the large creatures and their overbearing personas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>warm hills and mountains (Dykon)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, binomial (2), coefficient (3-5), or polynomial (6 or more)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Populating Triaxian children&rsquo;s horror tales, ursikkas roam the Triaxian wilderness during the wandering planet&rsquo;s winter years. These enormous, nightmarish praying mantises stretch 20 feet in length and stand as tall as 25 feet&mdash;mostly due to the long, slender walking legs on which they skitter with an eerie speed. Ursikkas&rsquo; grasping forelimbs each end in sharp pincers capable of shearing flesh from bone, and their three-part maws can open wide enough to swallow humans whole. Freezing saliva drips from their gnashing mandibles, which can injure and trap prey.</p>\n<p>Ursikkas are endlessly hungry creatures that act primarily on instinct. As such, they view all smaller creatures as food. During their planet&rsquo;s long winters, ursikkas terrorize @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}&rsquo;s extensive rural lands to secure the several tons of meat they need each week&nbsp;to survive. They prefer to consume large, cold-blooded creatures, but hungry ursikkas pursue any viable prey, particularly victims that seem sluggish and easy to catch.</p>\n<p>As winter draws to a close, ursikkas become especially ravenous as they prepare for a long hibernation in their summer abodes: cocoons constructed from their own freezing saliva. The cocoons&rsquo; temperature resistance makes it an exceptional insulation material for delicate machinery, and Triaxian factories long ago devised chemical baths that make the cocoons more pliable. Freelance hunters can collect considerable bounties for these cocoons.</p>\n<p>Summerborn ryphorians actively seek and destroy slumbering ursikkas&mdash;not only to profit off their cocoons and hides, but also to cull the predators before they awaken the next winter and pose an active threat to communities. These local crews and hunting teams periodically join forces, each benefiting from the others&rsquo; aid. Their joint hunting ventures are limited to the summer seasons. This is in part because ursikkas almost always consume their cocoons to recoup the expended nutrients when they emerge in winter, and also because hunting hibernating ursikkas is safer than tracking active ones. The creatures are still ferocious even in summer, but their saliva production slows considerably during hibernation, and unless an awoken ursikka can eat enough to build a new cocoon, it often dies from exposure. Disturbed ursikkas sometimes rampage in the verdant summer wildernesses, desperate to eat and then return to sleep.</p>\n<p>Thanks to their tempestuous tempers and voracious appetites, ursikkas typically live solitary existences. However, where prey is abundant, ursikkas sometimes live in pairs or, rarely, in small hives. Even then, they typically hunt alone and fiercely guard their kills from their kin.</p>\n<h2>URSIKKA HIDE ARMOR</h2>\n<p>Some of the most intrepid hunters seek out ursikkas&mdash;and wily scavengers often search the tundra for fallen ursikka bodies&mdash;to harvest their hides. Ursikka hides are light, supple, and have an insulating quality that traps body heat, making them an ideal material for cold weather gear and clothes. Talented armorsmiths can create flexible light armor from this leather, which grants cold resistance in addition to the benefits listed on the table below. Basic ursikka hide armor provides cold resistance 10, and the resistance increases to 15 and 20 for advanced and elite suits respectively.</p>\n<p>Ursikka hide armor is uncommon in shops on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}, rare across the Pact Worlds at large, and nearly impossible to find elsewhere in the galaxy. In some places on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}&mdash; especially in the rural Allied Territories and Ning&mdash;wearing a suit of ursikka hide armor is a point of pride, a symbol of one&rsquo;s courage and hunting prowess. For this reason, and to reap the rewards from selling this valuable resource, mercenary bands sometimes fan out across the planet&rsquo;s rural locales specifically to gamble their lives on hunting these violent creatures.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 99.1279%; height: 153px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 54px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 15.5243%; height: 54px;\">ARMOR MODEL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.3102%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 54px;\">LEVEL</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.66404%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 54px;\">PRICE</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.38416%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 54px;\">EAC BONUS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.38416%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 54px;\">KAC BONUS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.10653%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 54px;\">\n<p>MAX DEX</p>\n<p>BONUS</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3561%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 54px;\">\n<p>ARMOR CHECK</p>\n<p>PENALTY</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.4647%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 54px;\">\n<p>SPEED</p>\n<p>ADJUSTMENT</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.94979%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 54px;\">UPGRADE SLOTS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.94984%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 54px;\">BULK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 15.5243%; height: 33px;\">Ursikka hide, basic</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.3102%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.66404%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">12,500</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.38416%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.38416%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.10653%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3561%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">-</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.4647%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">-</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.94979%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.94984%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">L</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 15.5243%; height: 33px;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">Ursikka hide, advanced</span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.3102%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">13</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.66404%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">46,000</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.38416%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.38416%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">16</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.10653%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3561%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">-</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.4647%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">-</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.94979%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.94984%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">L</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 15.5243%; height: 33px;\">Ursikka hide, elite</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.3102%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">17</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.66404%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">240,000</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.38416%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.38416%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.10653%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3561%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">-</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.4647%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">-</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.94979%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.94984%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; height: 33px;\">L</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any arctic (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or hive (3&ndash;10)</p>\n</section>"

Valkyries appear on battlefields throughout the galaxy in search of combatants of great skill and renown, supernaturally aware of who is ready to accept death’s embrace and who yearns to fight on another day. When she locates such a target, a valkyrie can either claim the soul of a deceased warrior or aid the living to continue the battle. Though space travel is a relatively recent development for some mortal species, the valkyries took to the stars long ago to advance their quest of collecting the souls of worthy fighters. As a result, diverse cultures across the universe, most notably those of the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, recognize these powerful extraplanar creatures as choosers of the slain.<br/><br/>Valkyries are always female and frequently appear as powerful and majestic @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} or vesk women. A @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} valkyrie is 6 feet tall and weighs close to 200 pounds, while a vesk valkyrie is 8 feet tall and weighs approximately 300 pounds. Valkyries may take on the appearance of other species if they wish, and references to “warrior angels” wreathed in lightning exist within many cultures outside the Pact Worlds.<br/><br/>Valkyries are most often associated with gods of war, conflict, valor, and courage. Some valkyries are independent, serving no deity directly-a fact that suggests the outsiders are mercenaries by nature and have complex, ever-changing allegiances to the divine. Whatever a given valkyrie’s associations, her duty is sacred: to protect the souls of slain heroes on their journey from the Material Plane to the Boneyard, where they face judgment and learn their final destination in the Outer Planes. What qualifies a soul for this honor varies by deity-and various cultures and faiths across the galaxy interpret the worth of a warrior in vastly different ways. Valkyries hold a special place in the dominant religion of the Veskarium, where they are referred to as the Spear Maidens of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.pq08s1mZZyi97PBA]{Damoritosh}.<br/><br/>Valkyries also come to the aid of warriors who are near death-or even recently dead-but still have a fierce drive to fight on. In this way, a valkyrie’s intervention has turned the tide of battle in countless conflicts across the galaxy.<br/><br/>The mysteries surrounding the afterlife extend to valkyries and their practices, and mortals have questioned for millennia why the striking outsiders shepherd the souls of dead heroes. Some skeptics even posit that valkyries divert souls from their rightful course, collecting them for some great and terrible conflict to come, or stocking grand arenas for the entertainment of beings of unknowable power and alien intellect. This theory holds little credence among scholars, however, who note no recorded conflicts between valkyries and servants of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VQrVznzrr85I90TI]{Pharasma}, the goddess of life and death, who would certainly object to such subversion.<br/><br/>In the years since the Gap, many valkyries have forgone their traditional sleipnir or pegasus mounts and adopted modern suits of armor. Armor and weapons created by valkyrie engineers blend the latest nanocarbon and polymer technology with powerful magic, resulting in creations that armorers of the Material Plane can only dream about. Occasionally, a valkyrie might gift such a suit of armor, or perhaps a unique weapon, to a mortal warrior she deems worthy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or ride (2-8 valkyries)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

A jiang-shi that fell to its death on a warm, wet world would likely have twisted or broken limbs and be in a state of advanced putrefaction, while one who was killed by laser fire on an airless asteroid in the void of space might exhibit laser burns but manifest no signs of decomposition at all. Regardless of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing or gear that is out of style, if not completely outdated, due to the fact that it can take decades-or even centuries-before a jiang-shi rises from the dead.<br><br>All jiang-shis display a prayer scroll in front of their faces. In ancient, pre-Gap days, these prayer scrolls were handwritten on parchment and affixed to the corpse’s brow with stitches or staples in order to protect the deceased from the ravages of restless spirits. In modern times, holographic prayer scrolls projected in front of a jiang-shi’s forehead have typically replaced the parchment scrolls and protect the jiang-shi’s body from both physical and magical harm. If a jiang-shi’s prayer scroll is ever stolen or destroyed, it loses the defensive benefits granted by the scroll (see above), but the jiang-shi may replace it with a handwritten scroll. This requires a strip of paper or cloth, a writing implement, and 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Alternatively, a jiang-shi can recreate a holographic prayer scroll by crafting a hybrid holoskin (Starfinder Core Rulebook 220) to project the scroll. This requires at least 2 ranks in both the Engineering and Mysticism skills and UPBs worth 500 credits.<br><br>Because most jiang-shis become undead only after their corpses have undergone some measure of decomposition, their bodies often display signs of rigor mortis. The rigid inflexibility of a jiang-shi’s muscle tissue makes the creature’s movements especially stiff, and causes the distinctive bouncing gait which gives jiang-shis their colloquial name of hopping vampires. Nevertheless, jiang-shis can be surprisingly nimble in rough terrain, and the stiffness of their joints has little adverse effect in zero gravity.<br><br>Jiang-shis are horrified by their own reflections, and the sound of a handbell or the call of a rooster fills them with terror. Cooked rice, which reminds jiang-shis that they are dead and can no longer eat normal food, shames them. Curiously, uncooked rice and other types of grain (cooked or not) don’t affect jiang-shis at all, though rice mixed with vinegar and the dust of a destroyed jiang-shi prevents that vampire from returning to unlife.<br><br>Although they normally try to avoid daylight, jiang-shis suffer no detrimental effects from sunlight and can move around during the day unharmed. Nevertheless, most jiang-shis prefer to operate at night or in darkness, when their more obvious physical traits are not as noticeable to the living among whom they mingle. On the other hand, a glowing holographic prayer scroll can be difficult to conceal in the darkness.<br><br>Jiang-shis tend to lead solitary existences, but they are not averse to working with other undead creatures, especially if those undead feed on the flesh of the living, leaving the victim’s chi for the jiang-shi to drain. However, jiang-shis are known to be jealous of blood-sucking vampires because of their ability to create their own undead spawn. As a result, most hopping vampires refuse to cooperate with their bloodsucking rivals, even if they might profit from such an arrangement.<br><br>In the Pact Worlds, jiang-shis are most associated with the dead world of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, though the hopping vampires can be found anywhere there are living, breathing creatures to feed upon. Some jiang-shis serve as officers in the exiled Corpse Fleet as well, working just as tirelessly as their other undead comrades-in-arms for Eoxian supremacy and independence. At least one of the Golden League’s powerful families is said to be led by an ancient jiang-shi matriarch who was alive on pre-Gap Golarion, and inhabitants of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}’s “Downside” swear that a cabal of seven jiang-shis has inhabited an abandoned level of the Spike since at least the end of the Gap. Each member of the cabal supposedly “specializes” in drinking the breath of just one species, and refuses to feed on the chi of a different race.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or cabal (2-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<section>\n<h2>Varculak</h2>\n<p>Varculaks, also known as soul wights, are undead that occur when a humanoid dies with an intense desire to continue living. The longing turns to anger as life slips away, but the varculak’s will is strong enough that the soul doesn’t pass on into the River of Souls for @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VQrVznzrr85I90TI]{Pharasma}’s judgment. Instead, a portion of the mortal essence passes away, leaving behind a soul with little memory of who it once was, and locked inside a halfliving body. What remains is grim determination and rage. Among occult scholars, this state is known as “the Curse of Varcul.” The legendary first varculak, once a human named Varcul, supposedly existed thousands of years before the Gap. Some say he still does, and varculaks make a deal with him to continue living—a bargain they don’t remember.<br><br>A varculak looks much as they did in life, except limbs and sensory organs outside the human norm wither away and turn to dust. Lashuntas, for example, lose their antennae, while kasathas lose their extra arms and strix lose their wings. (Some speculate this effect is related to the fabled Varcul and his erstwhile humanity, or he requires his “offspring” to make these sacrifices.) Eyes undergo a notable change, the orbs giving way to points of cold light, which can be of any hue. Except for this alteration, a varculak who has eaten or rested recently can look almost alive, but becomes pale and drawn quickly between periods of refreshment, and varculaks never look so much like corpses as when they sleep. These changes prevent them from passing for a normal member of any humanoid species.<br><br>Most varculaks are creatures of deep passion. They have a sense of life as fleeting, and they seek not only to experience what it has to offer, but also to give it purpose. Varculaks are rarely idle. If anything, they can be obsessive and, having died once, are averse to fewer risks than the living. A lucky few remember some important task they left unfinished in their previous life and make that their purpose. In this way, many varculaks end up reintegrating with the society that death temporarily separated them from.<br><br>Some varculaks, however, remember only the circumstances of their death. This one recollection can lead a varculak who died violently to focus on vengeance, seeking those responsible. That done, a varculak can become obsessed with the chain of blame, condemning nearly anyone for even a tenuous connection to the varculak’s death. If a mercenary killed such a varculak, the undead seeks first that mercenary, then the mercenary’s entire company, then those who hired the mercenary, and eventually even those responsible for the conflict that led to the varculak’s demise or the manufacturer of the weapon the mercenary used for the deed. A varculak on such a path of destruction is more likely to face a second and final death than to reach the path’s end.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Exiled aeons ago from the First World for unspeakable crimes against other fey, svartalfars fled to the Shadow Plane. When @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} bestowed Drift technology to the universe, svartalfars channeled their vengeful energies away from the fey who expelled them to focus on an inscrutable endgame spanning both the galaxy and the planes. Many of these calculating killers have realized that the universal currencies of money and power can advance their race further than can the arcane knowledge they once sought as payment for their services.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac</h2>\n<p>Sometimes called “kytons” by mortals, velstracs are cruel fiends who dwell on the Shadow Plane. Each velstrac seeks to unlock its highest potential by following a path of methodical, self-inflicted pain while also psychically feeding on the fear and anguish of mortal creatures. Velstracs care only for this path of pain and its mystical destination; they see “lesser” beings as nothing more than stepping-stones for their own ascension.<br><br>Transformation requires a velstrac to excise pieces of itself, spiritually and physically. Dross is cut away and replaced with grafts—artificial or natural, flesh or spirit, magical or technological. Each graft brings the velstrac closer to its ideal state and increases its power. In this practice, velstracs are more fanatical than even the Augmented are about cybernetic augmentations. The emotions and pain experienced during each step, they believe, cause spiritual evolution.<br><br>Legend holds that the first velstracs emerged when mortals conceived of cruelty as an acceptable means of personal advancement. The goodly gods, astonished and dismayed, chained the velstracs in Hell. However, instead of struggling against their bonds, the velstracs subsumed their chains and eventually escaped into the Shadow Plane.<br><br>Velstracs leave the Shadow Plane to prey on sentient creatures. They maintain installations and portals in dark locales, launching forays into the Material Plane from such places. Most mortals who fall into velstrac clutches are doomed to live out the remainder of their days—or minutes—in agony. However, such mortals can sometimes become velstracs themselves. The supposed methods of this shift differ wildly, but all involve terrible suffering that only escalates after the transformation is complete. These newest velstracs often become anchorites, fiendish ascetics devoted to the torment of themselves as much as of others. An anchorite’s first act must be to willingly mutilate its flesh, showing its dedication to the velstrac way.<br><br>Anchorites are among the lowest-ranking fiends in the velstrac hierarchy. Often working in pairs or squads, they are crafters, gophers, and soldiers. Anchorite labor produces the majority of velstrac equipment, from their starships to their hide armors with inward-pointing studs and spikes. Anchorites take pains to make their creations macabre and ornate. These velstracs also make up the rank and file of velstrac exploration teams and starship crews.<br><br>In battle, anchorites aim to inflict maximum amounts of delicious agony upon themselves and their foes. Sharing pain is an ecstasy to anchorites as they guide each other along the path of evolution. Few velstracs of any sort refuse to telepathically pair with an anchorite and at least taste its pain, and it’s a rare and disgraceful act for an anchorite to refuse to share with another. A stronger velstrac who takes advantage of an anchorite to survive an otherwise deadly conflict is not considered to be acting dishonorably because in velstrac doctrine, the weak exist to serve the needs of the mighty. All velstracs answer to the demands of their strongest, the velstrac demagogues.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac Starships</h2>\n<p>A clear hierarchy commands all velstrac groupings, including the fiends’ starfaring forces. The velstracs’ fast and sleek&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/Starship_Examples.aspx?ItemName=Velstrac%20Corvette&amp;Family=Velstrac%20Starships\">corvettes</a>&nbsp;serve as heavy scouts and raiders, cutting into enemy territory and fleets like serrated blades.

			"name": "Veolisk",
			"description": "<p>Veolisks are lumbering, reptilelike quadrupeds with bony exoskeletons. They are often compared to many planets’ prehistoric megafauna, despite being much smaller. Veolisks are typically found only on remote planets and planetoids in the Vast, as most xenobiologists believe their maddening gazes tend to drive off other species and make settling near veolisk territory very difficult. If veolisks are discovered near established communities, the creatures are usually hunted ruthlessly until there are none left.<br><br>The veolisk’s signature void gaze ability has led to speculation that the creatures are descended from ancestors with similar gaze attacks that had far more severe effects, and they have earned the nickname “void basilisks” from those versed in the ancient folklore of Golarion. Some sages believe destruction-loving cultists of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.JpQpQbdXNOX6aTVG]{The Devourer} bred the first veolisks millennia ago, well before the Gap. Whether or not this is true, the beasts have become popular as guardians of remote Devourer cult bases and as pets to those who believe themselves to be at one with the universe’s entropy. Curiously, though most cultures would never think to try domesticating veolisks, the beasts become quite docile and mostly harmless when wearing blinders, veils, or other methods of negating their gaze ability.<br><br>These hulking beasts can survive on very little food, usually eating only one small meal-flesh, fruits, fungus, plant life, or anything it can find-a day. Scientists don’t agree on exactly what maintains a veolisk’s physiology; some believe the creatures simply have a hyperefficient metabolism, while others suggest that they feed on cosmic radiation like trees gathering sustenance through photosynthesis. A few experts theorize that veolisks don’t need to eat at all to survive and subsist solely on the background arcane energies that are present everywhere in the galaxy. Reputable xenobiologists tend to scoff at this hypothesis, but their opponents are quick to point out that universe is full of strange and unknowable wonders that defy scientific explanation.<br><br>Veolisks lay fist-sized leathery eggs, usually six to eight at a time. These eggs are recognizable as belonging to a veolisk due to their ebony coloring and their tendency to give off faint wisps of odorless smoke. Once laid, the eggs don’t require any kind of incubation and usually hatch on their own after a few weeks. In most broods, the first veolisks to hatch tend to devour the unhatched eggs as their first meals. Veolisk young begin to hunt for themselves after this initial meal and are fully mature in less than a year. Adult veolisks usually mate whenever the opportunity presents itself, though neither parent takes any interest in their eggs or offspring.<br><br>A typical veolisk is about 7 feet long from the tip of its snout to the end of its tail and weighs approximately 200 pounds.</p>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Void hags are terrifying scourges of deep space, enacting their cruel whims on any innocents who cross their paths. A typical void hag stands over 7 feet tall but weighs no more than 150 pounds. They have long limbs, and their hands and feet are similarly elongated, ending in disturbingly sharp, silvery nails. Most void hags have substantial heads of hair that they let loose to frame their faces in the low- to zero-gravity environments in which they dwell.<br /><br />No one is certain whether void hags are crones who adapted to living in outer space (greatly changing their physiology in the process) or a race of alien witches from a distant, unknown world. Void hags aren&rsquo;t interested in elucidating their origins to those they consider to be lesser beings, which is just about everyone they come across. Rather, void hags instinctively wish to rule over other life-forms, usually cooperating only with other void hags. On occasion, power struggles break out between allied crones, but they often end swiftly and brutally as one overpowers the other. Void hags despise stupidity in any form, and they find great satisfaction in punishing it, usually in ways that are quite painful and often fatal to the victim.<br /><br />Though it grants her only a small portion of her power, a void hag&rsquo;s set of robes is her most important possession. She views the robes as a badge of honor, since a young void hag must undergo a series of harrowing trials to craft them. First, she weaves the cloak from fibers of plants found on naturally irradiated worlds. Then, she finds a star emitting strong solar flares and waits for a phenomenon known as a coronal mass ejection&mdash;a massive explosion of plasma and magnetism&mdash;in which she bathes the robes. If she survives, she drags the robes into the center of a nebula, collecting cosmic dust and ionized gas particles along the way. She then dons the robes and meditates, often for days, until she visualizes a pattern of stars that she imprints upon the cloak. The design of each set of robes is personally important to the void hag who crafted it, and no two sets of robes look the same.<br /><br />This process can take years&mdash;or sometimes even decades&mdash;but once finished, the void hag is bonded to her robes and only the strongest magic can separate her from them. However, until a void hag makes her robes, no other hag will see her as an equal. Some void hags go so far as to completely ignore those of their kind who haven&rsquo;t crafted their own robes. A void hag in a coven (see below) who somehow loses her robes is forcefully driven out, even though it strips the coven of all power. Even if the expelled hag retrieves her robes (or fashions a new set), she usually must form an entirely new coven, as her previous compatriots never fully trust her again.<br /><br />Void hags have been seen within @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.psZBx1kcx9pHsLrz]{Apostae}, aiding a handful of @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} noble houses in the constant corporate espionage the race perpetrates against one another. Void hags who are diligent and sadistically inventive can rise to be major players in a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} corporation&rsquo;s security division, sometimes rooting out spies from within and leading strike teams against other @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} holdings. However, a void hag can never climb higher than that on the corporate ladder, as those positions are almost always exclusive to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} nobles.<br /><br />Though @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Ave5caJSxVvKFVAB]{Aucturn} might seem to be a place of great interest to void hags, they avoid that planet with almost no exception. Some sages claim that the crones are afraid of the Stranger and its disturbing inhabitants. Void hags scoff angrily if this theory is ever espoused in their presence and give vague hints about &ldquo;certain pacts&rdquo; made with potent entities that lead them to avoid @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Ave5caJSxVvKFVAB]{Aucturn}. No one has been able to get further clarification out of void hags on the matter, and so it remains an unsolved mystery.<br /><br />Void hags have a similarly standoffish relationship with the Dominion of the Black, though members of the two groups will sometimes deign to work together in extreme circumstances. Such a partnership is always short lived and tense, probably because void hags suspect that deh-nolos and neh-thalggus would eagerly collect their brains if given half a chance.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Void Hag Covens</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Three hags of any type can band together to form a coven, gaining access to more powerful magical abilities. Covens of void hags are particularly formidable, and they often lay claim to entire asteroids or other small planetoids as their domains. A void hag coven will often craft a roughly square container called a stellar cauldron out of unknown materials that can somehow withstand the various arcane fission and fusion processes studied by the void hags. A stellar cauldron acts as a focus for many of the coven&rsquo;s rituals and is sometimes used to brew powerful serums and spell ampoules. Scientists from across the galaxy would love to get their hands on one of these stellar cauldrons to examine its composition, but void hag covens are as protective of their cauldrons as an individual void hag is of her robes.<br /><br />Whenever all three void hags of a coven are within 10 feet of one another, they can work together to use any of the following spell-like abilities: <em>call cosmos</em> (DC 24), <em>clairaudience/clairvoyance</em>, <em>control gravity</em> (DC 25), <em>gravitational singularity</em> (DC 25), <em>interplanetary teleport</em>, <em>retrocognition</em>, <em>snuff life</em> (DC 25), <em>telepathy</em>, and <em>vision</em>. All three void hags must take a full action to take part in this form of cooperative magic. All coven spell-like abilities function at CL 13th (or the highest caster level of the most powerful hag in the coven). The coven also ignores Resolve Point costs of the spell-like abilities.<br /><br />At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, other hag covens might have different spell-like abilities.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any vacuum</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">solitary or coven (see above)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

This plant creature is exceedingly rare, and the lack of information about its biology allows it to surprise oblivious explorers. When a suitably large living creature wanders nearby, a void palm plunges the area around it into magical darkness while simultaneously interrupting gravity’s normal function. Creatures caught in this area might become unable to propel themselves out of range of the void palm’s lashing fronds-something the plant deliberately makes more difficult by using its leaves to sweep the area around it clear of debris that might be used as handholds or counterbalance.<br><br>Though they are rare, void palms are found across the galaxy. Their unique method of reproduction lends itself well to a slow but inexorable colonization of the stars. Once a year, a void palm produces a brilliant blue seed at the end of each of its stalks over the course of a week, and then it flings its progeny into the sky. The remarkable seeds each carry the void palm’s supernatural ability to ignore gravity, allowing the momentum imparted from their parent to carry them off the void palm’s planet and onto new ones. This unique ability makes void palm seeds rare and expensive curios.<br><br>The typical void palm is 15 feet tall and weighs around 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any land</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>While it is unknown exactly what happens to any starfarer unfortunate enough to be pulled into a black hole, most scientists are certain that nothing can survive the multitude of gravitational forces that batter anything that passes the event horizon. However, reports of strange undead creatures appearing on starships and space stations near these deadly cosmic phenomena have led @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} mystics aboard the @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari} to conjecture that the terrible agony undergone by those consumed by a black hole sometimes allows their spirits to escape the phenomenon and continue on to wreak havoc among the living. The kasathas call such entities vorthuuls, though they are sometimes referred to as singularity wraiths by others. A vorthuul is a strange apparition that appears to be composed of two intertwined forms: one a squat, obsidian skeleton that emanates calm, the other the phantom visage of a creature eternally screaming in unbearable pain as it is stretched to impossible lengths. Neither of these forms ever separates from the other, though one spirit always seems to have dominance at any given moment, pulling along the other with its whims.<br/><br/>@Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} sages suggest that these two entangled spirits were once a single living creature that suffered the extreme misfortune of being pulled inexorably into the mouth of a black hole. In this moment, where time and reality get twisted, the black hole creates two versions of the same creature: one that is tortuously extended vertically while being compressed horizontally, and the other that is crushed into infinite density as it is drawn into the singularity. Both versions of the original creature are horribly killed, of course, and their spirits are linked to one another through quantum entanglement.<br/><br/>While no one knows precisely how these two versions of the same creature’s spirit combine to form an undead vorthuul, those who travel the void know the true dangers these creatures present. Seemingly able to harness the gravitational forces of a black hole, a vorthuul is a horrifying sight for a party of adventurers hoping to loot an abandoned starship or mine precious metals from the surface of an asteroid.<br/><br/>A vorthuul can appear on a starship, research station, or other celestial object when it passes close to a black hole (though not close enough to be caught by the singularity’s gravitational pull), seemingly manifesting as an avatar of the black hole itself. A singularity that has swallowed countless souls might be “home” to a large group of vorthuuls, making the region of space near that black hole particularly dangerous to living creatures. Such collections of vorthuuls often go unreported if no one makes it out of the area alive, leading to rumors of “haunted” stretches of space.<br/><br/>Solarians-especially those of the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} species-are especially aware of and concerned with the threat vorthuuls pose. Some solarians believe that many vorthuuls were once members of the same tradition who became disproportionately attuned with graviton forces. Their connection with the cosmic forces of gravity and light became imbalanced, contributing to their rebirth as vorthuuls, and they now seek out living solarians to completely destroy them.<br/><br/>Other groups, such as the Cult of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.JpQpQbdXNOX6aTVG]{The Devourer}, respect the vorthuuls’ uncanny power, viewing them as avatars of their god of infinite destruction, and may even attempt to capture a vorthuul in an attempt to unleash its wrath upon their foes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>vacuum</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or supermass (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

		"Vracinea": {
			"name": "Vracinea",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The vracinea is one such predator, a shambling plant creature with several fanged mouths and large blossoms that both attract living creatures with psychic impulses and exude a scent that holds prey in place. Standing almost 12 feet tall, a typical vracinea weighs 2,000 pounds, though one currently digesting a victim might be heavier.<br><br>Usually, a vracinea forsakes its mobility to lie in wait for its next meal, covering its lower half with nearby vines and branches and leaving only its blossom lures visible. If possible, it situates itself in a clearing or at the top of a rise to maximize its hunting range. Once its mesmerized prey has gotten close to it, the vracinea allows its flowers’ paralyzing odor to wash over its victim before the plant creature bursts forth from its camouflage and attacks. If an injured prey manages to shake off the scent’s effects and attempts to escape, the vracinea will pursue as best it can for a short time before giving up and beginning its hunting cycle over again, often selecting a new location in the process.<br><br>Xenobotanists aren’t certain of the mechanisms behind a vracinea’s blossom lures, as only a few scientists who set out to study these plant creatures have returned with evidence. Some believe the flowers vibrate at an almost subatomic level, stimulating a target’s subconscious desires, while others think that the vracinea transmits psychic impulses to its prey through the flowers. Either way, affected creatures can’t help but move toward the vracinea until they get caught within the plant’s paralyzing scent aura, after which they are quickly devoured.<br><br>Vracineas are solitary and territorial creatures. When two come into contact, they often charge at one another, quickly becoming locked in a struggle of gnashing teeth until one falls dead or retreats to nurse its wounds. The stakes of such skirmishes can be especially high, given that nearby prey are often unable to resist the draw of both creatures and end up standing by, paralyzed. The winning vracinea claims any such prizes and claims the nearby territory. It then picks a new hiding spot and patiently waits for other victims to appear. Rarely, a starving vracinea-easily recognizable by the deep purple coloration of its blossom lures-will pursue, kill, and feast on the loser of a contest of dominance, though this is the only time a vracinea partakes in cannibalism. In fact, a vracinea usually refuses to eat other plant creatures; xenobotanists believe those that do are in fact attempting to reach unabsorbed meat in the other creature’s system.<br><br>On @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, vracineas flourish on the continent of Ukulam, where they can stake expansive hunting grounds and avoid other voracious members of their species. All is not completely peaceful, however, as many vracineas compete for food with the jungle’s other carnivorous creatures, such as tentacled ksariks and serpentine mountain eels. Over many generations, ksariks have learned to detect the scent of vracineas from greater and greater distances, along with the knowledge that they have little to gain from ingesting a vracinea’s genetic information. In addition, the two plant creatures tend to be evenly matched, making any confrontation between the two dangerous for both. As a result, they generally only come into direct conflict in times of desperation, or occasionally when a ksarik is tracking victims infected by its carrion spores. Mountain eels, on the other hand, are often more powerful than vracineas, though the two only fight for resources if a vracinea attempts to claim part of a mountainside frequented by a bed of mountain eels for its hunting ground. Usually outnumbered, a vracinea is quickly dispatched by mountain eels, but occasionally one of the plant creatures discovers a nest of newly born elvers left behind by its parents and enjoys a grand feast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>temperate and warm forests (@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel})</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

Terrifying to behold, these aberrations have several barbed, insectile legs supporting a massive, bulbous torso that writhes and roils with the flesh of victims they&rsquo;ve grafted into their bodies. The warpstitcher&rsquo;s back has five slender appendages that each taper into needle-like points of extraordinary sharpness. The creature&rsquo;s infamy and name stem from their hunting strategy: they pin down their victim, skewer its flesh, and use shimmering thread to sew the hapless creature into their bodies.</p>\n<p>Those few who&rsquo;ve survived being sewn to a warpstitcher claim the stitches pulse with energy that trigger disturbing visions, such as the victims&rsquo; deaths in alternate realities. For most, the revelations prove so painful or incomprehensible that those survivors&rsquo; minds suffer irreparable damage. A rare handful instead experience different visions entirely, emerging from the near-death experience with an ineffable sense of revelation and euphoria. This possibility has led desperate sensates to hunt down a warpstitcher on the off chance of attaining this strange enlightenment, as survivors sometimes achieve unprecedented witchwarping powers. Most die, however. Once a victim&rsquo;s consciousness has been utterly destroyed, a warpstitcher absorbs the body that continues to kick and contort from unseen nightmares. No one knows for certain if a warpstitcher feeds off its victims&rsquo; flesh, thoughts, energy from other timelines, or something else entirely.</p>\n<p>Warpstitchers hunt those who wield powerful magic or technology recklessly, believing such abuses create dimensional echoes that damage alternate realities. Upon identifying a target, warpstitchers stalk their quarry relentlessly, confirming their suspicions before striking. They favor targeting witchwarpers, whose magic frequently violates numerous warpstitcher taboos. Other potential prey for these aberrations include those who wield supernatural power, especially irreverent solarians and engineers of space-bending technologies. Warpstitchers hold a special hatred for Drift engines, believing that starships that have them inflict terrible wounds on extraplanar ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Although they&rsquo;re most often encountered as remorseless assassins, warpstitchers regularly communicate with others telepathically. In some cases, they might deliver a grim admonition to an amateur spellcaster practicing their first cantrips, only to disappear seconds later. More often, warpstitchers assert control over a group of weaker creatures through lies and manipulation, promising to tell their subordinates&rsquo; futures or open a portal to extradimensional riches in exchange for obedience. For all the aberrations&rsquo; power, they almost never have the capability to fulfill these promises. Instead they rely on coercing others into making up for their shortcomings, such as by transporting the warpstitchers to other worlds, providing magical support, or securing rare lore that might help the warpstitchers find their way home and undo the Gap&rsquo;s damage.</p>\n<p>Warpstitchers&rsquo; most dangerous lies, however, might be the ones they tell themselves. Many warpstitchers believe that eons ago, when the infinite fabric of the multiverse amounted to no more than a single thread, the gods created their kind to sew together the space between alternate realities. There, warpstitchers reinforced cosmic boundaries and mended tears resulting from interdimensional paradoxes. That is, until the Gap, when warpstitchers woke to find themselves ripped from their interstitial realms and condemned to live among mortal creatures. Many warpstitchers blame witchwarpers for the Gap and the warpstitchers&rsquo; subsequent exile. The aberrations&rsquo; own mythology insists these spellcasters greedily altered reality to eliminate warpstitchers and to access immense magical power before creating the Gap to erase the memory of their deeds and hide their betrayal.</p>\n<h2>WARPSHOT AMMUNITION</h2>\n<p>Made from razor-sharp fragments of warpstitcher claws housed within reinforced bullets, scattergun shells, or warheads, warpshot transforms on impact into whatever would best devastate the target.

It is an undisputed fact, however, that witchwyrds were the impetus behind the construction of the kasathas’ worldship @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari} and their exodus from their home planet to the Pact Worlds.<br><br>Witchwyrds can be found on nearly any world or plane with civilized trade, preferring dry, warm regions, but virtually nothing is known of their mysterious home world beyond its name: Cyrune. The details of witchwyrd government and society are likewise unknown, other than a widespread belief that a mercantile oligarchy of witchwyrd elders directs their race’s interplanetary and interplanar trade.<br><br>Most witchwyrds operate as solitary traders, primarily focusing on one area of trade (such as weapons or magic items), though most deal in other goods as well. Virtually all witchwyrds love haggling, to the point that the process of bargaining sometimes seems more important to a witchwyrd than the eventual deal that is struck.<br><br>Witchwyrds often travel with a crew of loyal humanoid mercenaries hired from worlds they’ve visited in the past. These hirelings never speak of their remuneration, purportedly forbidden from doing so by punitive clauses in their contracts. Witchwyrds can be encountered throughout the Pact Worlds, though they’re most commonly found on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}, and the @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}.

			"name": "Wrikreechee",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Spindly and deliberate, wrikreechees are chitinous filter feeders who bear as much a resemblance to mollusks as they do to airbreathing humanoids. Their two lower limbs are robust, capable of clinging to jagged surfaces for extended periods, while their forelimbs bear dozens of long, fibrous whiskers that fan out like baleen to catch passing food particles. These forelimbs each also bear a set of three grasping claws, with which a wrikreechee can manipulate objects, tools, and weapons.<br><br>Wrikreechees are natives of Akchios, a lonely, watery planet with a fairly eccentric orbit around an orange main-sequence star. Over much of its existence, Akchios was covered in ice miles thick, melting only partly every 3 years when the planet drew closer to the sun. Fairly simple life developed in its concealed oceans, feeding upon nutrients surging from deep-sea vents. Only a modest range of more complex life-forms evolved in the lightless depths, and among these were the wrikreechees: soft-bodied organisms who developed rigid exoskeletons that allowed them to wander and feed during the warming cycle. During the cooling cycle, they molted their shells and retreated into coral-like constructions to conserve energy and socialize with their wintering colony. As best as modern scholars can tell, their kind evolved self-awareness and higher thought processes as a direct extension of this communal living. Though the species developed only rudimentary technologies in the absence of fire and metallurgy, their cultural love of history, mathematics, and philosophy made them a highly educated people.<br><br>For the past 100,000 years, Akchios’s sun has grown hotter, melting more and more of the planet’s icy shell. Several centuries before the Gap, Akchios thawed enough to expose its immense ocean, revealing the cosmos to the wrikreechees for the first time. They had already developed complex astronomic theories by the time Pact Worlds explorers arrived 50 years ago, and although the wrikreechees still had only simple tools, they had the academic aptitude to quickly understand and adopt the visitors’ technologies. While still fairly uncommon beyond their home world, traveling wrikreechee scholars and engineers are renowned for creating wonders of architecture and adapting old technologies in innovative ways.<br><br>Among the wrikreechees’ most important developments are a swath of pharmaceuticals and inexpensive biotech solutions that have helped them adapt to life in dry environments. Most importantly, these include a series of hormonal enhancements that allow a wrikreechee to maintain its shell year round and a biotech vocal enhancer that helps the creature project its voice and enunciate at near-@Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} levels- without which a wrikreechee’s simple jaw and throat mangle a range of consonants and can barely project above a whisper in air. Much of the Wrikreechee language is conveyed through arm movements and chirps, with entire syntactic structures expressed solely through vibrations felt only over short distances in the water. These grammatical constructions are reserved primarily for terms of endearment, trust, and understanding. As a result, wrikreechees emit a nearly inaudible buzz around dear friends, and they find communication over comm units distressingly sterile.<br><br>Temperature fluctuations remain the bane of most wrikreechees; because of their adaptation to seasonal stimuli, they become noticeably torpid in cold weather, and heat can spur practically manic bouts of energy. Those who can afford to do so wear suits with environmental controls to maintain their body temperatures-and prevent any mood swings that would otherwise result. Most wrikreechee travelers delight in clothing and crowded rooms, finding both to be suitable replacements for the colonies they left behind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any aquatic or urban (Akchios)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, fixture (2-7), colony (8-20)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

			"name": "Writher Swarm",
			"description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>A writher swarm consists of thousands of pale white fungal filaments that wave slowly back and forth, as if swaying in a light breeze. This mobile mold creeps its way through even the narrowest of crevices to infest a building and slowly digests all the organic matter within, whether discarded food, flesh, or wood. A writher swarm leaves behind only ceramic, concrete, metal, plastic, and stone, making them less of a threat in large urban centers where structures are largely composed of such materials, but potentially devastating to less advanced settlements.<br><br>A single spore of a writher swarm can lie dormant for as long as several centuries, whether as a passenger on a meteor or in a cavern deep below the ground. Under the right conditions, that spore can attach to a modicum of organic material, such as a stale piece of bread or the rotting corpse of a tiny animal, after which it quickly begins growing and multiplying. If it is not eradicated, a writher swarm becomes fully mobile in a matter of weeks and can start to seek out new sources of nourishment. Even if a writher swarm presence is discovered before this point and thoroughly scoured, it’s likely that several spores will survive undetected, possibly hitching rides to new environs.<br><br>Though a writher swarm’s tiny filaments can pierce hide and flesh, the true danger comes from the infectious particles it can implant in the wounds of its prey. These infestations grow at a rapid rate just under the victim’s skin, draining the creature’s vitality, forcing it into a coma, and eventually killing it. Unless the unfortunate victim is treated before it dies, it becomes host to a new writher swarm, which tears its way out through the creature’s skin after it dies.<br><br>When a writher swarm infests a structure for several decades-getting enough food to sustain it but not causing so much death as to draw attention to itself-it grows long, rootlike filaments that thread through the floors, ceilings, and walls. This allows the plant to surround itself with a kind of organic security system that alerts it as soon as new prey sets foot in its domain. However, this fungal framework can eventually supplant the building’s own structural supports, and when such a writher swarm dies and its network of filaments turns to dust, the surrounding building often collapses soon afterward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any temperate or warm lands</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

These new wysps became specialized, turning into air, earth, fire, and water wysps as they were each attuned to a single Elemental Plane. Despite all these changes, these modified wysps retained the cheerful and curious disposition of their ancestors.<br>While most wysps lead lives dedicated to the service of other elemental beings, a few small groups of wysps have escaped the influence of the elemental lords and returned to lifestyles more akin to their ancestors. Led by wysp conductors who have regained their natural affinity for the music of creation, these bands of wysps rarely stay in one place for long. Free symphonies of wysps tend to be cautious around anyone they suspect may want to take away their independence, responding to potential dangers by fleeing across the planes rather than engaging in confrontation.</span></p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Elemental Planes)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or symphony (one plus 5-20 wysps)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>"

At first glance, a xaarb appears to be an innocuous spherical lump of short, dark fur. Xaarbs have large eyes and four stout appendages, which they use to alternate between walking on all fours and standing upright. When frightened or riled, however, xaarbs can open their massive mouths to reveal jaws that take up most of their bodies, filled with long, pointy teeth.<br/><br/>Xaarb society is based entirely on physical dominance over other xaarbs-or anyone else they encounter. Xaarbs who have established supremacy over others can demand both obedience and tribute from their lessers, which is the expected method of gaining wealth and status; having to bargain or pay for something is considered an unspeakable shame. Only wars against other sapient species in Arybus allowed the xaarbs to stay united enough to become a starfaring race. Xaarbs eventually conquered their star system, but when interstellar travel via @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} opened up the rest of the galaxy, xaarbs found themselves encountering-and outmatched by-both the Veskarium and the Azlanti Star Empire. This sobering paradigm shift shattered xaarb culture into three major factions. “Lesser” xaarbs accept that the vesk and Azlanti are dominant over them, and dutifully serve those races. “Greater” xaarbs muster their forces in order to some day conquer the other empires and reassert xaarb authority. “Unspoken” xaarbs-the most scattered of the species-feel that xaarb society has proven insufficient and now attempt to assimilate into and cooperate with other cultures. Unspoken xaarbs are considered the most reasonable of their kind by outside races, though their instinctual need to assert dominance at all occasionally surfaces.<br/><br/>Xaarbs are a species with only one gender, making gender roles a strange curiosity to them. They can understand the common languages of other species but can’t speak them. Their own language consists of a series of hand gestures and silent movements of their jaws. A particularly communicative xaarb might use a text-to-speech generator to talk to other species.<br/><br/>Site Owner: Blake DavisEmail Spam Checker: MX Guarddog</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Arybus system)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, crew (3-12), or squadron (13-30)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

Created by a vanished race of plane-hopping aliens to serve as their mounts, xanthoi still exhibit the natural curiosity and teleporting capabilities of their absentee masters. Their capacity for effortless travel and their drive to observe, collect, and catalogue knowledge give them a long history as field researchers, but the end of the Gap marked a drastic shift in xanthos mindsets. While other species despaired at the collective loss of so much history, the xanthoi celebrate the Gap as the period of their masters’ return. They believe their creators utilized powerful magic or technology to compile all accumulated information in the universe, taking a large chunk of it with them when they again departed at the end of the Gap. They celebrate this erasure as an opportunity to learn anew, free from the misconceptions of the past, and proselytize the inevitable return of their masters, whom they believe will bring about a second Gap.<br/><br/>Understanding that their masters have already collected the “old knowings” that they and others have gathered throughout history, xanthoi now focus their acute observational skills on current events of all sorts. They seek to understand and document everything from political upheavals and interstellar wars to fashion trends and technological advances. Grand celestial occurrences and the final scores of local sporting events captivate them equally, and every moment of their wandering lives is recorded and uploaded into local infospheres. These firsthand accounts often gain popularity on social networks and news outlets, with the famed impartiality of the xanthoi making them ideal-if somewhat dry and over-technical-commentators.<br/><br/>Site Owner: Blake DavisEmail Spam Checker: MX Guarddog</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
