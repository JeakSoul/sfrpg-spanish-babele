According to the report, Aurok 6&rsquo;s aboveground nations enjoy peace and quiet due to the contributions of a planetary law enforcement agency with international jurisdiction, known only as the Adjudicators, who wield psychic technology and governmental authority to act as judge, jury, and executioners when pursuing criminals. Since the broadcast, several weapons manufacturers have secretly visited the planet, and now examples of experimental &ldquo;judgment tech&rdquo; weapons accessories can be found on various dark infospheres throughout the Pact Worlds. The most notable of these is a scope, known as an adjudicator&rsquo;s eye, that can supposedly determine the guilt or innocence of a target.</p>\n<p>An adjudicator&rsquo;s eye functions as a combined laser scope and nightvision scope (Starfinder <em>Armory</em> 61), but it also contains mnemonopathic sensors capable of scanning a target&rsquo;s memories for recollections of a specified crime or attempted crime.

For the next 10 minutes, when aiming or looking through the scope, the sensors automatically scan targets to reveal their perception of guilt or innocence in regards to that question. Each target must succeed at a DC 18 Will saving throw or the adjudicator&rsquo;s eye searches their memories for information about the specified question. These memories indicate only whether or not the target remembers themself as being innocent or guilty of the crime in question, and they do not necessarily reflect the truth (as in the case of someone who has been affected by modify memory). The scope places a &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; indicator over any target that recalls participating in the specified crime, and an &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; indicator over any target that has no memory of the crime or who succeeded at the Will save. Deactivating an adjudicator&rsquo;s eye is a move action.</p>\n<p>The adjudicator&rsquo;s eye imposes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls made with the weapon it is attached to against any unscanned target or any target the scope has deemed innocent.</p>"

With either a mental command or a programmable interface built into the hand, you can reconfigure your hand into the shape of various tools. The hand can contain programming for nine different tools, in addition to a configuration for a normal hand for your species. As a move action, you can switch the setting, causing the adamantine pieces to realign into the shape of the chosen tool. The tool has all the flexibility of the normal tool (or of a hand, if set to that).<br />Programming a new tool into the polyhand takes 10 minutes, and you must choose either to fill an empty slot or to replace a programmed tool. The tool replicated must be 8th level or lower. The polyhand can replicate the moving parts of a tool, but you must supply any fuel or batteries needed for the tool to function. The tool cannot produce substances, and since it&rsquo;s not very conductive (important so as to avoid shocking the user), it can&rsquo;t serve as a power conduit or data transmission line. The GM has final say in deciding which tools you can duplicate. The tools within engineering kits and similar kits can be duplicated, subject to the restrictions above.<br />You can&rsquo;t replace the hand setting based on your biology, which is required for the polyhand to function properly. You can add a hand corresponding to another species in any slot that isn&rsquo;t reserved; for instance, a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} could program her polyhand to replicate a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} hand. This can&rsquo;t duplicate features of a unique individual, such as thumbprints. You can install a polyhand into a prosthetic limb that replaces an arm as if the prosthetic were a natural arm.<br />The adamantine construction makes the polyhand extremely durable (see page 408 in Chapter 11 for more information about adamantine). This doesn&rsquo;t change the amount of unarmed strike damage, no matter the form your polyhand is in. The polyhand can&rsquo;t maintain structural integrity if extended too far, so it can&rsquo;t assume a form more than one and a half feet long in any dimension. Consequently, it can&rsquo;t extend your reach.</p>"

Such attacks traveling through low gravity or high gravity areas respectively count every third affected square or count each affected square three times when calculating the attack&rsquo;s penalty due to range.</p>\n<p>The first time a creature enters or starts its turn in an area of microgravity, it can attempt a Reflex save. If successful, it automatically gains its bearings enough to fly, can move at half speed along any surface on which it was already standing, can take guarded steps, and can move along that surface as though the surface had sufficient handholds (or gains a +5 bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks to navigate the surface if it already had such handholds). If it fails the save, it is affected by zero gravity conditions normally and becomes off-kilter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 85.5569%; height: 96px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 21.4635%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\"><strong>MODEL</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.1296%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\"><strong>LEVEL</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8723%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\"><strong>PRICE</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.2432%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\"><strong>EFFECT</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 21.4635%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Mk 1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.1296%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8723%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">140</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.2432%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Explode (1 step for 2 rounds, 10 ft.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 21.4635%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Mk 2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.1296%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8723%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">575</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.2432%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Explode (1 step for 2 rounds, 10 ft.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 21.4635%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Mk 3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.1296%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8723%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">2,650</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.2432%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Explode (2 steps for 2 rounds, 10 ft.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 21.4635%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Mk 4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.1296%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">14</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8723%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">9,500</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.2432%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Explode (3 steps for 2 rounds, 10 ft.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 21.4635%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Mk 5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.1296%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">19</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.8723%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">83.000</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.2432%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Explode (4 steps for 2 rounds, 15 ft.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

Each anvil consists of a heavy iron block anchored to a 5-foot-diameter stone base engraved with magical runes and symbols. Anvils of Torag are much prized by dwarf collectors and the crafting guilds of dwarven star citadels, as the anvils are seen as a tangible link to Torag, the patron god of the dwarves, who disappeared during the Gap. While non-dwarf collectors often consider an anvil of Torag too precious to use, most dwarves think it&rsquo;s ridiculous to have a crafting relic and not actually use it.</p>\n<p>An anvil of Torag aids in crafting equipment and magic items. If you use an anvil of Torag while crafting an item, you are considered to have 2 additional ranks in the appropriate crafting skill, allowing you to craft items of higher level than you would normally be able to create. A given anvil of Torag can be used to craft only one item per day.</p>\n<p>Due its bulk and size, an anvil of Torag is generally not portable and must be properly anchored before use. An anvil of Torag can be installed on a starship in an arcane laboratory, a cargo hold, or a tech workshop, or it can be placed anywhere with room to store a Large vehicle.</p>"

The Atrocite Sphere must adjust to your soul by floating 3 inches above your head for 24 hours. If the sphere stops floating above you for more than 1 minute, it must readjust to you. The sphere can float above you while you&rsquo;re prone or unconscious, but it stops doing so if you die. After it adjusts to you, the sphere exudes a slight pull, like gravity.</p>\n<p>While the Atrocite Sphere floats above you, you gain DR 10/&mdash; and energy resistance 10 against all energy types. If you gain a higher value in one of these defenses from another source, that value increases by 2. When it blocks damage, the sphere briefly flashes with crimson light that resembles a black hole&rsquo;s accretion disc.</p>\n<p>When you take Hit Point damage from an attack or effect a foe created, as a reaction you can redirect some of the damage dealt to you. When you do so, the sphere flashes with crimson light and pulses with gravity, knocking you prone. Divide the damage dealt to you in half. If your attacker is within 330 feet of you, it takes this damage as force damage, is knocked prone, and suffers any critical effect the attack inflicted, but it suffers no other effects. The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 20 + your Charisma modifier) to take half damage and avoid any critical effect. You take the remaining damage (though you get to apply your defenses to this damage normally).</p>\n<p>After you redirect damage with the Atrocite Sphere, you go berserk. This compulsion is a mind-affecting effect, but it works on any creature the sphere has adapted to, even if that creature is normally immune to such effects. While you are berserk, you gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls and a +3 morale bonus to damage rolls and Strength checks. You also gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to 3 times your level or CR, which remain only while you stay berserk. However, you take a &ndash;2 penalty to KAC and EAC.

You consider no creature to be your ally, although you don&rsquo;t consider erstwhile allies to be foes.</p>\n<p>On each of your turns while you&rsquo;re berserk, you attack the opponent closest to you, moving or charging only if you need to do so to attack. You make a full attack if you can, using abilities or weapon special properties that facilitate making numerous attacks. When you make a full attack, you reduce the penalties for doing so by 1. If multiple opponents are equally close to you, you divide your attacks among them or include as many as you can in a full attack such as automatic fire.</p>\n<p>You cease being berserk if you lose consciousness or you&rsquo;re aware of no other enemies.

They can&rsquo;t differentiate between illusions or holograms and real objects.

If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit against an appropriate foe, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Stunned} effect. When you add this fusion to a weapon (or create it as a fusion seal), you must select a single creature type (aberration, animal, construct, dragon, fey, humanoid, magical beast, ooze, outsider, plant, undead, or vermin) against which it will apply. If you select humanoid or outsider, you must also select one subtype. The @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Stunned} critical hit effect applies only against creatures of the selected type (and subtype, if selected). Once selected, the creature type and subtype can’t be changed.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Battle ribbons are difficult to use without training, so most who take up the battle ribbon seek apprenticeship with the famous battleflowers of Ning to learn the elaborate performance art&mdash;though acquiring such a mentor is difficult, as they take students only rarely. Battle ribbon varieties start with modern materials used in a traditional blade, then proceed to the innovations of the microedge and zero-edge battle ribbons.</p>"

While no astute starship captain would ever install a blabbersponder on their own ship, such devices are often sold in gray markets to saboteurs serving the whims of corporations, or bounty hunters who wish to gain vital information about a specific starship&rsquo;s defenses. Some clever pirates of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora} are also rumored to sell blabbersponders to gullible spacefarers by offering them as upgrades to starship communication systems. They then use the data they collect from the device to determine if the cargo, defenses, weapons, and crew aboard the ship warrant the effort of intercepting and ambushing it later.<br /><br />To install a blabbersponder on a starship computer, you must succeed at an Engineering check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the starship&rsquo;s tier). Once installed and activated, the blabbersponder&rsquo;s internal computer uses its control module to automatically hack into the computer it&rsquo;s attached to. The control module reads and broadcasts all data related to the starship&rsquo;s systems, allowing any science officer aboard another starship within passive sensor range of the blabbersponder&rsquo;s ship to use the scan action on that vessel, even if the two ships aren&rsquo;t engaged in starship combat. Because of the detailed information provided by the blabbersponder, the science officer performing this scan action gains a +5 circumstance bonus to the associated Computers check, and the broadcasting ship doesn&rsquo;t add the bonus from its defensive countermeasures to the DC.<br /><br />Detecting that a blabbersponder is in fact an instrument of sabotage and not a benign technological device before it is installed requires a successful DC 25 Engineering or DC 30 Perception check. Discovering an installed blabbersponder aboard a starship requires a successful DC 28 Computers check. When an installed blabbersponder&rsquo;s battery is depleted, it recharges itself using the starship&rsquo;s power core in a process that takes about 5 minutes; on the day this occurs, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to the Computers check to notice the sudden, short surge in power use and discover the blabbersponder on your vessel.

The mask counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br /><br />As a standard action while wearing the mask, you can forcefully inhale. If you do so, creatures that need to breathe within a 30-foot-radius spread of you must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw or become short of breath, rendering them fatigued for 1 minute. You can exclude any number of creatures from this effect. @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} offer no benefit against this effect. A target @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} by the mask can attempt a saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending that condition on itself if successful. A target that succeeds at such a save still remains fatigued for the full duration.<br /><br />Once you use this item, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you take a 10-minute rest during which you could regain Stamina Points.

Powered armor uses the same type of batteries as other items, including charged weapons, and the battery for a suit of powered armor can be recharged as normal using a generator or recharging station (see page 234), or it can be replaced with a new battery when spent (see Table 7&ndash;9: Ammunition for battery pricing).</p>\n<h3>Entering and Exiting</h3>\n<p>Getting into or exiting a suit of powered armor requires a full action. Unless noted otherwise, a suit of powered armor has an electronic lock preventing anyone from opening it without knowing the passcode. The passcode can be determined with a successful Computers check (DC = 15 + double the armor&rsquo;s level).</p>\n<h3>Powered Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Characters can gain proficiency with powered armor by taking the Powered Armor Proficiency feat (see page 160) or at 5th level through the soldier&rsquo;s guard fighting style. Lacking proficiency in powered armor comes with more significant drawbacks than with other types of armor. If you are wearing powered armor with which you are not proficient, you take a &ndash;4 penalty to both EAC and KAC, you are always flat-footed and off-target, and you move at half speed. If the armor has a special form of movement (such as a fly speed), you cannot use that movement.</p>"

If your space is occupied when you return, the suit shunts you to the nearest open space that can accommodate you, dealing 1d6 damage to you for every 5 feet it has to shift your destination.<br />While disappeared, you cannot be harmed or detected by mundane or magical means, as if you had ceased to exist.</p>"

			"description": "<p>Your armor is wired to allow an integrated onboard computer to monitor your condition and operate some functions of your armor. An armor interface comes with a tier 1 computer with an artificial personality and a single control module linked to your armor. You can access this computer without exposing it or yourself to the environment outside of your armor, and you receive information from it through heads-up displays and broadcasts via your armor’s integrated comm unit.<br>With a successful Computers check (DC = the DC needed to hack the computer) you can set the computer to give basic information about your condition (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and so on) to authorized users (which you designate), or to anyone with a medkit, advanced medkit, or medical lab. Characters who can access this information gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks they attempt on you.<br>With 10 minutes of work, you can set the computer’s control module to operate any one system in your armor, as long as that system doesn’t take a full action or longer to activate or deactivate. Common applications are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} or a force field armor upgrade. You can set the computer to operate the upgrade at your command (allowing you to activate one such item each round without taking an action to do so), or set it to automatically trigger the system under specific conditions as follows: the first time you take damage, the first time you take Hit Point damage, when you are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Stunned}, when you are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered}, when you are unconscious, or when the atmospheric conditions change. If the trigger occurs, the computer automatically activates the linked system. This occurs at the end of your next turn after the condition occurs. The control module can be linked to weapons or tools that are part of the armor, subject to the normal limitations of control modules (Core Rulebook 215).<br>You can install a higher-tier computer into the computer interface, as long as it has light or negligible bulk. You must pay for the additional computer separately, and installing it requires a successful Computers check with a DC equal to the DC to hack the new computer. The computer cannot have countermeasures that require links to the environment beyond the armor (such as a shock grid) or control modules that control anything other than armor systems, and it cannot activate more than one system each round (even if linked to multiple systems with automatic triggers).</p>"

If that&rsquo;s true, there could be a containment tesseract holding a being that knows truths lost to the current age.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you can command the tesseract to imprison a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 19 + your key ability score modifier). A creature that has already been imprisoned in a containment tesseract can roll the saving throw twice and take the higher result. On a failure, the target disappears into the tesseract and remains inside, unharmed and unaware, until released. The tesseract can hold only one creature at a time.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, as a standard action, you can command the tesseract to release a creature within it. The released creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or become helpful toward you for 1 hour.

This has no additional effect on targets already within the line, but anything that moves across your weapon’s line is attacked using your original attack roll and damage. If you hit but fail to damage this new target, it blocks your line as normal. If an existing blockage is removed, your line extends out to its maximum range unless blocked anew, and it can damage creatures and objects that it failed to reach previously. You can’t damage a single target more than once in a round with the <em>continuous</em> fusion, even if it moves in and out of the path of your attack.

While osifern sprouts contain the same chemicals needed to produce these medicinal extracts, they yield such small quantities that harvesting enough to create even a single dose has proven inefficient, though not impossible. Deep indigo extract follows the rules for medicinals presented on pages 231&ndash;232 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook; two examples are described below.</p>\n<h3>Cytoguard</h3>\n<p>Similar to an antitoxin, cytoguard actively regenerates cellular damage, mitigating the immediate effects of poison. When you take or are injected with cytoguard, you gain resistance equal to 3 times the medicinal&rsquo;s tier to the damage dealt by initial exposure to poison. In addition, you gain a bonus equal to the medicinal&rsquo;s tier to saving throws against poison.

A mystic can do this a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus.<br /><br />A technomancer can designate a&nbsp;digital harrow deck&nbsp;as her spell cache. If she does, the deck&rsquo;s AI integrates with her own consciousness, providing her with a +1 bonus to her caster level for divination spells and effects. Additionally, she can spend 1 Resolve Point as a swift action when she casts a technomancer spell to draw upon the algorithms that allow the deck to function, adding a +1 insight bonus to the spell&rsquo;s save DC.</p>"

Dimensional comm units are a kishalee version of the comm units commonly found in the Pact Worlds, but they function using the remnants of the vast demiplane network utilized by the now extinct kishalee civilization. The advantage of dimensional comm units is that their text and verbal communications are instantaneous, whether in the same system or through interstellar space, but because of the degraded state of the kishalee dimensional network, they work only sporadically. Prior to use, a dimensional comm unit must be linked with at least one other unit&mdash;a process that takes only a minute when all units to be linked are on the same planet. Dimensional comm units nearly always work when used on the same planet to reach other linked devices. Over greater distances, each time a dimensional comm is used, there is a 50% chance that it will function properly if used in the same system or a 25% chance if the communication is interstellar (this is rolled in secret by the GM), but only with linked dimensional comm units. If two linked dimensional comm units make a connection, they retain that connection for 24 hours. If the dimensional comm units don&rsquo;t manage to connect, the users can try again after 24 hours.

The display is attached seamlessly to a cylindrical clockwork engine the approximate size and weight of a fire extinguisher, containing myriad ancient-looking cogs and gears incongruously integrated with more modern parts. A series of tuning forks of varying lengths, which protrude from the top of the apparatus, move when a large mechanical crank affixed to one side is operated. Three times per day as a standard action, you can aim the device at a single creature within 30 feet and turn the crank clockwise five full turns; this requires the use of two hands. This causes the&nbsp;dimensional modulator&rsquo;s&nbsp;engine to generate bright flashes of energy, the symbols on its display to change rapidly, and the tuning forks to spin, rise, and fall, emanating an eerie tone. The target must then succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be immediately transformed into a two-dimensional creature for 1d4 rounds. If the target succeeds at the saving throw, there is a 50% chance that you are affected by the dimensional modulator instead. You must attempt the same saving throw, but if you fail, you are transformed for 1d6 rounds instead.<br /><br />Any creature that becomes two-dimensional in this way is perfectly flat and thin as paper, as if the creature is an animated painting or living shadow.

Chain restaurants are ubiquitous and tend to be cheaper, but they have less variety and the food is lower quality. Independent venues are more expensive, but they often employ master chefs who create the highest-quality food in all the Pact Worlds. The prices listed in Table 1&ndash;33 are averages, and the quality of the restaurant corresponds to the quality of the meals served. Dining at independent venues with well-known or famous chefs can be even more expensive, with prices equal to the head chef&rsquo;s total skill bonus in Life Science multiplied by 10.</p>\n<h2>Pact Worlds Cuisines</h2>\n<p>Many Pact Worlds species have unique culinary trends. These ethnic cuisines show the breadth of options available in the Pact Worlds and do not affect the price of food or meals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kasathas: Kasathan recipes are usually traditional and exclusively use plants and animals native to their original home world of Kasath. Kasathan cuisine has a decidedly alien appearance that many other species find disturbing, though most dishes are surprisingly savory and delectable.</li>\n<li>Lashuntas: Lashuntas delight in using local flora and fauna in their cuisine, emphasizing the use of native berries, fruits, and nuts to make delightfully palatable dishes. Lashuntas consume a variety of animal products, but arthropod meat&mdash;especially from giant insects&mdash;is most common. According to some old stories, lashuntas adopted this custom as an insult to their ancient enemies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, the insectile formians.</li>\n<li>Shirrens: While artfully prepared, traditional shirren cuisine is almost always served raw, accompanied by honeys and nectars as both drinks and sauces for other dishes. Shirrens also eat meat in addition to vegetarian fare, though they prefer vermin and other lower life-forms, consumed still living and moving. To many shirrens, food is yet another choice in which they can express their individualism, and they are more than willing to experiment with other foods, often incorporating elements of other cuisines into their cooking.</li>\n<li>Vesk: Vesk food tends to be pragmatic and utilitarian, as if every dish were handcrafted by a drill sergeant who didn&rsquo;t care much for cooking. The exception to this rule is meat, which any self-respecting vesk agrees is the most crucial component of any meal. Vesk treat preparing and seasoning meat as an art, assimilating and enhancing each new world&rsquo;s recipes for cooking meat almost as quickly as they conquer them.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki}: The fact that ysoki will eat whatever they can get their paws on is largely reflected in their cooking. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki} fare tends to be scavenged meats and cheeses served either as finger foods or in stews, and the food is often questionable in color, quality, and texture. Many other species tend to avoid eating ysoki cuisine if they can help it.</li>\n</ul>"

The visor looks like a pair of virtual reality goggles marked by glowing magical runes. A domination visor must be programmed or reprogrammed by someone trained in both Computers and Mysticism in a process requiring 1 day of work. The visor requires a full action to put on, and the subject must be helpless, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}, or willing.<br />Once donned, a domination visor plays its program over the course of 1 minute, during which time the subject is exposed to a potent, magically augmented virtual reality that subtly reprograms their conscious mind. The subject must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be subject to an effect similar to dominate person, obeying whatever instructions have been programmed into the visor. A domination visor can be removed with a move action; if the domination visor is removed at any time during the 1 minute required for its program to complete, the dominate person effect fails. The commands implanted by a domination visor last for 24 hours, after which the effect ends. No new orders or commands can be given, and if the target is forced to take actions against its nature, it gets a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. The subject can&rsquo;t carry out self-destructive orders. A domination visor can be used only once per day.</p>"

A Drift gauntlet is a six-fingered glove of articulated adamantine plates with four knuckles on each finger, readily wearable on any hand-like appendage, regardless of handedness. When you put on a Drift gauntlet, your hand painlessly transforms to fit its interior, giving you six four-knuckled fingers until the next time you take an 8-hour rest, when your hand regains its normal configuration. A creature must put on a Drift gauntlet willingly; it simply doesn&rsquo;t fit over the hand of an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p>The Drift gauntlet can&rsquo;t enter the Drift; if you&rsquo;re on a starship that engages its Drift engine while you&rsquo;re wearing it, you and the gauntlet get left behind. Once per day, you can grasp a creature or object with the Drift gauntlet and force it into the Drift. A creature can avoid this fate with a successful Will save (DC = 20 + your key ability score modifier); otherwise, it&rsquo;s cast into the Drift and must find its own means of escape. An unattended object you grasp is automatically forced into the Drift as long as it fits within a 10-foot cube.

Traditionally, the ceramic is created from soil constituents from the wearer&rsquo;s home world, and the anklets are a way to carry a piece of that home. (The rarest&nbsp;earthbound anklets&nbsp;contain clay from lost Golarion.) Pragmatically, through quantum entanglement and magical means, earthbound anklets provide you a connection to normal gravity.<br /><br />While you wear&nbsp;earthbound anklets, you can activate or deactivate them as a standard action. Wearing the active anklets allows you to act as if you&rsquo;re in standard gravity, ignoring the perils of high gravity and the benefits of low gravity. In zero gravity, you decide a gravitational up and down when you activate the anklets, changing this orientation as a move action. Activating the anklets in zero-g allows you to end the off-kilter condition as part of the same action, and you can then move relative to your subjective up and down as if you were walking on a solid surface.<br /><br />This standard-gravity effect applies only to you and to objects you hold or wear. If an object, such as a thrown weapon, leaves your possession, it is subjected to the gravity of your environment rather than that provided by the anklets.<br /><br />The anklets can remain active for up to 1 hour per day. This usage need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Once you benefit from a given set of&nbsp;earthbound anklets, you can&rsquo;t benefit from a different set for 24 hours.</p>"

An eldritch encephalon is a lifeless, severed humanoid head inscribed with necromantic glyphs that run from just above each eye, over the scalp, and end at the base of the skull. A mass of slender, writhing tentacles extends from the neck or skull of the encephalon, often roiling and trembling as if attempting to grasp something that isn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When placed on your shoulder, or on any patch of exposed skin that can support the weight of an average humanoid head, an eldritch encephalon burrows its tentacles into your flesh and merges with your physiology in a process that takes a full 24 hours to complete. Once attached, an encephalon counts as a worn magic item and can be sundered, but not disarmed. Once this process is completed, the command words to activate the encephalon are transmitted psychically to your brain, and the head seems to come to life as its runes begin to glow. The encephalon occasionally speaks of its own volition, espousing the thoughts and opinions of the spellcaster it was in life. You can never be bonded to more than one encephalon at a time, and removing one is a time-consuming process requiring a special necromantic ritual that takes several hours to perform. Any eldritch encephalon that has not been joined with a host creature for more than 12 days withers rapidly, disintegrating into dust.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An eldritch encephalon allows you to cast a small selection of spells as spell-like abilities depending on the item&rsquo;s model, using your character level as your caster level. The DC of any spell cast using an eldritch encephalon is equal to 10 + the level of the spell + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Mk 1: <em>Command</em>, <em>mind thrust </em>(1st level), and r<em>eflecting armor</em> each once per day.</p>\n<p>k 2: Hold person, mind thrust (2nd level), and see invisibility each once per day.</p>\n<p>Mk 3: Charm monster, mind thrust (3rd level), and remove affliction each once per day.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, being bonded with an eldritch encephalon has its drawbacks. Whenever you roll initiative for combat (or otherwise enter a very stressful situation, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion), there is a 50% chance that the encephalon attempts to take control of your body. To fight off this other mind, you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + half the eldritch encephalon&rsquo;s item level). Failure means you gain the confused condition for 1d4 rounds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.wSeE9HyAmM7lTdpo]{Confusion}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.SysRFlYml1f1Eofd]{Charm Monster}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.7XJ6x5BZv1k1eBBz]{Mind Thrust}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.YGkyMwEE6SLfZc4r]{Remove Affliction}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

The toggle is difficult to move, so switching it is a standard action. When you switch the toggle to &ldquo;lock,&rdquo; you can spend 1 Resolve Point to draw your emotions into the box, causing a ghostly image of your face to swirl within it. You experience virtually no emotion while your feelings are locked within; you can&rsquo;t benefit from morale bonuses, and you roll twice for saving throws against emotion, fear, mind-affecting, and pain effects, taking the higher result. If the higher result succeeds but the lower result fails, your image in the box visibly displays the effect, such as grimacing in pain, and the box gains an Emotion Point. You can&rsquo;t be detected by blindsight (emotion) or blindsense (emotion) while your emotions are in the feelings lockbox, but the box is detectable.</p>\n<p>When the switch is flipped to &ldquo;unlock,&rdquo; you immediately recover your emotions in a powerful rush, no matter your distance from the box or even if the box is on another plane. The switch flips back on its own after 24 hours, or as soon as the box gains 4 Emotion Points. Unlocking your emotions resets the box&rsquo;s Emotion Points to 0 and gives you a penalty to your Will saving throws equal to the number of Emotion Points that were in the box. Every 24 hours, this penalty is reduced by 1, although powerful effects such as miracle, psychic surgery, and wish can eliminate the penalty prematurely. While you have this penalty, you can&rsquo;t activate a feelings lockbox.</p>"

Constructed from a rare wood harvested according to strict ritual protocols that&rsquo;s further amplified with magic spells, the felnar&rsquo;s bed is filled with a web of interwoven metal strings attached to posts arranged around the outside of the instrument. A skilled felnar player plucks the instrument&rsquo;s lower strings while strumming the higher strings; most felnar compositions require the use of four hands to play. A bow is sometimes drawn across the higher strings. A felnar is traditionally powered by a relbattery, but it can be played for a short time on a naturally regenerating reservoir of magical energy that replenishes every day.<br />A felnar can boost the casting of certain spells. The caster must be familiar with the felnar and physically able to play it, but no check is necessary. Playing the felnar in this way can be combined with the casting time of any emotion, fear, or mind-affecting spell, adding a +2 enhancement bonus to the caster&rsquo;s caster level and to the saving throw DC for the spell.</p>"

		"Grappler": {
			"name": "Grappler",
			"description": "<p>A grappler is a high-tech anchoring device that can be attached to a cable line as a move action. The cable line can instead be threaded through the grappler, which takes 1 minute but adds the cable line&rsquo;s hardness and HP to the hardness and HP of the grappler (and vice versa). A grappler has clamps that can slide from its base along a cable line attached to it, allowing it to be climbed as easily as a knotted rope (see Athletics on page 136).<br /><br />You can attach a grappler through which a cable line is threaded to an immobile object that&rsquo;s at least 5 feet in width with a ranged attack against AC 5. If the grappler is fired at a moving object or a smaller object, you must hit that object&rsquo;s KAC + 8 to attach the grappler to the object. After it&rsquo;s attached, the grappler remains anchored until either you give a release command as a move action, the grappler is pried free with an Athletics check equal to the attack roll you made to attach it, or the grappler is destroyed. If a cable line attached to or threaded through a grappler is destroyed but the grappler itself was not damaged, the cable line is destroyed, but the grappler is unharmed. In this case, the grappler loses the excess hardness and HP that a threaded cable line added to it.<br /><br />You can also target a creature with the grappler. This is resolved as a grapple combat maneuver, but a creature struck with the grappler can still use its hands, and its movement is only restricted to remain within range of the length of the grappler&rsquo;s cable. In addition to the normal rules for escaping a grapple, the target can pry itself loose with a successful Athletics check (DC equal to your attack roll to grapple the target). Or, it can perform a sunder combat maneuver (see page 246) against the grappler. Even if the combat maneuver doesn&rsquo;t destroy the attached cable, the creature escapes the grapple.<br /><br />A grappler can be thrown as a grenade or set over the muzzle of a ranged weapon that targets KAC, in which case it has half the normal range increment of the weapon, and you use any weapon proficiency and bonuses to attack you have with that weapon. A grappler can be reused.</p>"

Traditionally, a Hellknight flail was a basic melee weapon with the archaic special property that had heavy iron chains affixed to the haft of the weapon. After the Gap, various Hellknight orders discovered instructions for the creation of Hellknight flails among their carefully archived records. As a result, modern Hellknights have recreated Hellknight flails by applying the binding and chained weapon fusions to batons and similar weapons. Order of the Chain Hellknights frequently use Hellknight flails, as do Hellknights of other orders, as well as other law enforcement agents and bounty hunters unaffiliated with the Hellknights, though to a lesser extent. The Hellknight flail presented in the table on page 50 is an incapacitator with the binding and chained fusions, and the price includes both the weapon and the fusions.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Incapacitator</strong></p>\n<p>When this nonreflective, dark-gray baton connects with a target, it discharges an electrical pulse that can stagger its victim.</p>"

The product’s launch was disastrous, and users logged hundreds of complaints about the knives’ needless complexity. As a result, inferno knives have flooded the market and become showy weapons for criminals and performers, though timing the blade’s ignition in combat remains an unpredictable art.<br>An inferno knife is a 4th-level basic melee weapon with the analog and operative special properties.

You wear the scanner on your head or headwear, wirelessly connected to your comm unit or eyewear. The assistant counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in your armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br /><br />As a move action while wearing the assistant, you can cause the device to magically ping an area within a 60-foot spherical spread of you. Using this ping, the software creates a 3D reconstruction of the area, which it psychically projects to you and all creatures you consider allies in the affected area. This image adjusts to show each creature where it is in the image. The ping doesn&rsquo;t sense through most objects, but it can sense through a closed door or window that isn&rsquo;t airtight, hidden, or otherwise sealed. However, any starmetal in the structure of the door or window blocks this benefit. The ping can detect creatures and objects beyond your line of sight and places them as features on the map. Images of such creatures and objects are sometimes distorted, especially if they&rsquo;re in motion.<br /><br />The&nbsp;infiltration assistant&nbsp;grants you and your allies in its area a +5 insight bonus to Perception checks to locate hidden creatures and doors within the mapped area. The bonus to find creatures applies only so long as those creatures remain in the same place.<br /><br />Creatures with ranks in Mysticism perceive the ping like a barely audible sound that raises goose bumps, and they can attempt a DC 25 Mysticism check to determine that something magical just happened. A creature concentrating on&nbsp;detect magic&nbsp;can sense the ping as a brief flash of magic, and a creature benefitting from&nbsp;arcane sight&nbsp;can see the ping as a literal flash of divination magic.<br /><br />An&nbsp;infiltration assistant&nbsp;can send out 10 pings per day. Each psychic image it produces lasts 5 rounds. As a move action, you can save the image on your comm unit or a similar device for later reference. This static image can provide you a map of the pinged area later without needing to ping it again, but it provides no bonus to Perception checks.<br /><br />Using the assistant creates magical resonance in creatures that benefit from it. Any creature that benefits from more than 10 pings in a given day experiences visual anomalies, becoming @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{Dazzled} until after an uninterrupted 8-hour rest.</p>"

When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a zipstick), the tape bonds into a single mass of plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 15 Hit Points. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon state, at which point it can be torn easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds.

Once you benefit from a given kinetic converter, using a different one before 24 hours have passed throws off your sense of balance and you become @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{Sickened} until after an uninterrupted 8-hour rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mk 1 (Level 8): Distance 10 feet per 5 damage; one use</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Mk 2 (Level 12): Distance 5 feet per 5 damage; two uses</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Mk 3 (Level 16): Distance 5 feet per 10 damage; three uses</strong></li>\n</ul>"

Other than always bearing some association with Oras, legends of the torc&rsquo;s origins are myriad and murky. Given the artifact&rsquo;s ability to appear without warning far across the galaxy from where it was last seen, it may be that there are several such torcs, with each origin story being true for one of the copies. In any case, the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Metamorphosis Torc </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">seems to appear in fecund areas where adaptation occurs at extraordinary speeds, such as in jungles, on worlds experiencing rapid speciation following a mass extinction, or </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">near sprawling biotech facilities.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The torc resizes to fit comfortably on any wearer. It can be activated as a full action up to three times a day, reshaping part of your anatomy and granting you a random species graft (</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Alien Archive 4 </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">140) for 24 hours for a system that lacks an augmentation, after which the system reverts to its original form. If you succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save, you can specify which body system the torc transforms, giving you a random species graft for that system; if you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you can pick the specific species graft obtained. If you fail the save by 5 or more, the torc can transform one of your systems that already has an augmentation, temporarily replacing an existing augmentation with a new one. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, you might acquire completely unique species grafts as the torc experiments with your physiology.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Metamorphosis Torc </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">is highly addictive, and each use exposes you to a mental addiction (</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Core Rulebook </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">418) that you can resist with a DC 20 Fortitude save. Each use of the torc is treated as taking a dose of a drug for the purpose of this addiction. At impaired, you manifest two species grafts whenever you activate the torc; at befuddled, you manifest three species grafts. Once you become disassociated, attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. If you succeed, you transform into a random (possibly unique) aberration, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, or plant under the GM&rsquo;s control. If you fail, your body melts into a nutrient-rich slime. Either effect can be reversed only with </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">miracle</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">wish</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, or equally powerful magic.

Inside the cylinder, a brain can survive indefinitely, locked away in its own thoughts. Attachments can allow the brain to see, hear, and speak; migo often attach such gear to access the brain&rsquo;s information.<br /><br />Once a&nbsp;mi-go brain cylinder&nbsp;has a speech attachment, it can converse. It has all its skills and memories, but nothing about the cylinder compels the brain to answer questions or to do so truthfully. Most enslaved brains have been conditioned via pain and isolation to be compliant to questioning, but those within newly created cylinders might need coaxing to cooperate. A brain is susceptible to any spell or power it was susceptible to before it became disembodied.

When you activate the mimic imager, it takes 1 round to circle you and scan your current appearance. The round after you activate the mimic imager, it creates a holographic duplicate of you in a square (or squares, if you are a Large creature) within 20 feet that you designate. This hologram includes minor sounds but not understandable speech. The hologram then mimics your actual movements (walking forward as you walk forward, raising a gun as you do, and so on) while maintaining the same distance from you. You must always remain within 20 feet of the image and maintain line of sight to it, or the image winks out with a flash of static. Detecting the duplicate as being a hologram requires a move action and a successful DC 20 Perception check. If you deactivate the mimic imager or it runs out of charges, the mimic imager must rescan you the next time it is activated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity</strong>&nbsp;40;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>4/round</p>"

The hovering mimic imager operates as the helmet-mounted version, except that the hologram created by the hovering mimic imager can also mimic speech in your voice, and the DC of Perception checks to identify the hologram is 30. As the hovering mimic imager isn&rsquo;t attached to you, the image can be up to 100 feet from you and doesn&rsquo;t require line of sight to you (although it must be within 20 feet of and have line of sight to the microbot). The hovering mimic imager can receive your directions by voice or via a signal from a personal comm unit or a datapad with a control module installed. The hovering mimic imager has sound baffling and a light-shifting shell to avoid detection, but a creature can notice it with a successful DC 25 Perception check. Detecting the microbot doesn&rsquo;t automatically reveal that your duplicate is a hologram, but its presence can provide creatures a clue that something unusual is going on. The hovering mimic imager is a Tiny technological construct with an AC of 20, hardness 8, 10 Hit Points, and a fly speed of 40 feet with perfect maneuverability. It cannot make attacks, and it fails any saving throw it is required to make. When the mimic imager has only 4 charges remaining, the hologram winks out and the hovering mimic imager immediately returns to you if it can. Your communication with a hovering mimic imager uses a wireless signal, and is therefore vulnerable to countermeasures such as signal jammers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity</strong>&nbsp;40;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>4/round</p>"

The effects of psychic trauma can be removed with the remove affliction spell (DC = 15 + half the item level of the mind rending weapon).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2>Table 1-13: Psychic Trauma</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 550px; height: 161px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 88.6667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">1-5</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 137.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">Anxiety</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 311.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e; height: 17px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">Shaken 1d4 rounds</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 88.6667px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">6-9</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 137.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">Indescision</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 311.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d; height: 17px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">Staggered 1d4 rounds</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 88.6667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">10-12</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 137.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">Dementia</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 311.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e; height: 17px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span style=\"background-color: #34495e;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.8rIj0ewW4bL8Uph5]{Confused} 1 round</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 88.6667px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">13-14</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 137.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">Amnesia</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 311.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d; height: 17px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span style=\"background-color: #7e8c8d;\">-5 penalty to all skill checks to recall knowledge for 24 hours</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 31px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 88.6667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e; height: 31px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">15-16</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 137.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e; height: 31px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">Paranoia</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 311.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e; height: 31px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">Not treated as an ally and can't treat any other character as an ally for 24 hours</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 31px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 88.6667px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d; height: 31px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">17-18</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 137.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d; height: 31px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">Despair</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 311.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d; height: 31px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">-2 penalty to attack rolls and saving throws for 24 hours</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 31px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 88.6667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e; height: 31px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">19-20</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 137.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e; height: 31px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">Phobia</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 311.667px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e; height: 31px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.BVdjvpucmvQU4cc1]{Panicked} 1 round</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

A&nbsp;mind scour&nbsp;scans the target&rsquo;s memory and personality, collates and organizes that data, and presents on the control console a summary of key findings, which can then be transferred to a personal comm unit or other storage device. Reptoids use this information to adopt a perfect disguise, taking advantage of everything revealed, including dark secrets, passwords, the names of individuals important to the target, and more.<br /><br />A&nbsp;mind scour&nbsp;must be used on a helpless, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}, or willing living creature, though it must also break down the creature&rsquo;s subconscious defenses. After 1 minute of work, the creature can attempt a DC 19 Will saving throw to resist the&nbsp;mind scour&rsquo;s mental probing. On a failure, the&nbsp;mind scour&nbsp;learns five pieces of secret information, usually answers to questions chosen by the user and entered into the control console before the process began. If the creature is still helpless, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}, or willing, the mind scour user can keep the device running for an additional minute to learn more, although the creature can make another saving throw at the end of that minute. A creature that succeeds can&rsquo;t be subjected to a&nbsp;mind scour&rsquo;s probing for 24 hours.<br /><br />The&nbsp;mind scour&rsquo;s probing is a mind-affecting, divination effect. Using a&nbsp;mind scour&nbsp;on a helpless or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious} creature is an evil act.</p>"

You ignore any penalties to Disguise checks for altering these major features, but you lack enough control to precisely match a specific individual.</p>\n<p><em>Advanced morphic skin </em>offers the same options as the basic model, as well as the ability to change your apparent sex and age, alter your height by up to 1 foot, and gain features of another species of the same creature type (although you don&rsquo;t gain or lose abilities as a result).</p>\n<p><em>Doppelganger morphic skin</em> offers the same options as the advanced model, as well as the ability to assume a specific individual&rsquo;s appearance within the augmentation&rsquo;s limits.

A&nbsp;motion-detection badge&nbsp;has 4 charges, which refresh daily, and an hour of activation uses 1 charge. While active, as long as you haven&rsquo;t moved for at least 1 round, the badge emits a quick flash of red light whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet, although creatures undetectable to normal vision (such as an invisible creature) don&rsquo;t trigger the flash. This flash is sufficient to alert you, but doesn&rsquo;t otherwise affect your vision or your actions. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each interposing closed door or substantial barrier (such as a wall at least 1 inch thick). You can attune the badge to a creature by touching it with the item, which takes a full action; you can attune the badge to up to 10 different creatures. When you are within 60 feet of one of these creatures, regardless of whether you have moved in the past round, the badge emits a yellow flash to let you know an ally is near. Attempting to attune an eleventh creature causes the badge to lose its attunement to the earliest attuned creature. Note that in certain environments, such as a crowded shopping center, the badge flashes so frequently as to be practically useless for detecting approaching threats.</p>"

If a creature or object occupies a square a vehicle formed from a&nbsp;motosphere&nbsp;would occupy, the&nbsp;motosphere&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t transform. You choose each vehicle&rsquo;s initial heading as it transforms. After being deployed, a vehicle turns back into a&nbsp;motosphere&nbsp;after 1 hour, or as a move action you can turn it back into a&nbsp;motosphere&nbsp;by entering a series of commands on the vehicle&rsquo;s controls. A single&nbsp;motosphere&nbsp;takes 24 hours to recharge before it can be used again.<br /><br />A vehicle formed out of a&nbsp;motosphere&nbsp;has a hardness of 7, and its hover jets allow it travel over both land and water (though not underwater). The vehicle has 14 Hit Points and becomes broken when it is reduced to 7 Hit Points or fewer. A vehicle that is reduced to 0 Hit Points turns back into a&nbsp;motosphere&nbsp;and can&rsquo;t be used until it is repaired (treat it as if it were broken).<br /><br />Motospheres&nbsp;can be sold back only in their original pack of four for the normal 10% of the set&rsquo;s purchase price; a set that is missing even one&nbsp;motosphere&nbsp;(or containing one that is broken) can be sold back for 2% of the set&rsquo;s purchase price.</p>"

While standard operating procedure mandates the destruction of these nanites to prevent any possibility of future replication, scientists have recruited adventurers to obtain such samples for study in the hopes of recovering data from the parent goo and learning more about its strange abilities.</p>\n<p>An ambitious scientist or inventor, their identity lost to the Gap, eventually found a use for the inert goo in the form of ingestible capsules. However, because of the pill&rsquo;s unpredictable results and the lack of a steady and reliable supply of raw material, it quickly became a hot black market item. Some claim it has the power of transforming the living into constructs, while others claim it simply functions as an expensive placebo.</p>\n<p>As a move action, you can swallow this silvery, one-time-use pill to hopefully gain an edge on the competition, though you risk deleterious side effects.

While wearing a&nbsp;necrotic mantle, if you are undead, you have the aura of a living creature instead of an undead for the purposes of magic or technology that can detect undead. You receive a +4 divine bonus to saves against any spell or effect that targets undead, such as&nbsp;control undead. In addition, if you are undead and fail a saving throw against a spell that both affects only undead creatures and has an ongoing effect (such as&nbsp;control undead), you can attempt a second saving throw after 1 round with the same DC as the first. If you succeed, you gain the same reduction in effect as if your initial saving throw had been successful. Additionally, any effort to determine whether a&nbsp;necrotic mantle&nbsp;you are wearing is a magic or technological item requires the creature making the determination to succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your key ability modifier).<br /><br />If you are undead and are by or in the area of an effect that restores Hit Points only to living creatures, you regain half the number of Hit Points instead of none.

If not for conservation efforts on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, tashtaris could have been hunted to extinction, since their photosensitive adaptations are difficult and expensive to duplicate through synthetic means. Cessation of hostilities between the formians and lashuntas has allowed a recent surge in the regulated trade of biotech that incorporates tashtari tissue. Explorers and scouts equip themselves with focusing membranes or filament mesh, and many people throughout the Pact Worlds use photoenergetic nodes for practical and cosmetic purposes.</p>\n<h2>Focusing Membrane</h2>\n<p>Implanting a tashtari&rsquo;s photoenergetic node into your hand causes the appendage to glow with faint light. As a move action, you can discharge energy stored in your photoenergetic node into an analog melee weapon that you are currently holding in the same hand that has this biotech augmentation installed. The released energy instantaneously superheats the melee weapon, causing the weapon to deal 1d6 additional fire damage on a successful attack. The affected weapon deals this additional damage for 1 round for every 2 character levels you have. While heated, the affected weapon also sheds light as a flashlight, lantern, or beacon (you choose when you activate the augmentation). Once you&rsquo;ve expended your photoenergetic node, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it immediately.</p>"

You gain electricity resistance 5. When you take 5 or more electricity damage from a single attack or effect (before applying your resistance), you glow in a 10-foot radius (increasing the light level by one step, up to normal light) until the end of your next turn. During this time, any electricity damage you deal with non-analog weapons before the end of your next turn increases by 1d6.</p>"

The hand can contain programming for nine different tools, in addition to a configuration for a normal hand for your species. As a move action, you can switch the setting, causing the adamantine pieces to realign into the shape of the chosen tool. The tool has all the flexibility of the normal tool (or of a hand, if set to that).<br>Programming a new tool into the polyhand takes 10 minutes, and you must choose either to fill an empty slot or to replace a programmed tool. The tool replicated must be 8th level or lower. The polyhand can replicate the moving parts of a tool, but you must supply any fuel or batteries needed for the tool to function. The tool cannot produce substances, and since it’s not very conductive (important so as to avoid shocking the user), it can’t serve as a power conduit or data transmission line. The GM has final say in deciding which tools you can duplicate. The tools within engineering kits and similar kits can be duplicated, subject to the restrictions above.<br>You can’t replace the hand setting based on your biology, which is required for the polyhand to function properly. You can add a hand corresponding to another species in any slot that isn’t reserved; for instance, a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} could program her polyhand to replicate a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} hand.

You can install a polyhand into a prosthetic limb that replaces an arm as if the prosthetic were a natural arm.<br>The adamantine construction makes the polyhand extremely durable (see page 408 in Chapter 11 for more information about adamantine). This doesn’t change the amount of unarmed strike damage, no matter the form your polyhand is in. The polyhand can’t maintain structural integrity if extended too far, so it can’t assume a form more than one and a half feet long in any dimension. Consequently, it can’t extend your reach.</p>"

Originally designed by Abadarcorp during the war between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, replenigel is intended to provide a soldier with all of their daily nutritional needs and an added resistance to @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions}, while digesting slowly enough to require a soldier to eat only once per day. To minimize packaging costs, Abadarcorp commonly shipped replenigel to the front lines in 50-pound blocks that, unappetizingly, resembled marbled sulfur. After the conflict with the Veskarium ceased, the corporation found itself with a surplus of replenigel cubes and no way to sell them. A particularly savvy marketing executive realized that subtle tweaks to the product&rsquo;s aesthetics could have a dramatic impact on its commercial viability. After extensive focus-group testing, Abadarcorp created Nutrimanders, reshaping the gelatin into sizable, 1-pound megavitamins molded to look like skittermanders and available in various artificial flavors and colors.<br /><br />It takes 5 minutes to consume a replenigel megavitamin. You gain 10 temporary Hit Points and a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases} and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} for the next 24 hours. In addition, you don&rsquo;t need to eat food or water for 24 hours. If you subsist on replenigel megavitamins for 5 consecutive days, you must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save at the end of that fifth day and on each subsequent consecutive day you continue to eat these megavitamins; the bonus from the megavitamin doesn&rsquo;t apply to this save. Failure means you develop a waxy sheen on your skin that makes you smell vaguely like a fermented version of the flavor of megavitamin you most recently consumed. Your skin remains this way for 1d4 days, during which time you take a &ndash;4 penalty to all Charismabased skill checks; if you consume another megavitamin during this time, the duration is increased by 1 day.</p>"

			"description": "<p>The translucent crystal network in a resonant gauntlet has its origins in the rings of the gas giant @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}. The rings contain crystal fragments thought to record every sonic vibration that passes through them. Researchers have yet to fully decode the information they hold, but they have been able to develop a material that shares some of the crystal&rsquo;s properties.</p>\n<p>A resonant gauntlet is a long glove with composited crystal and metal around the user&rsquo;s wrist, forearm, and knuckles. When a wearer strikes, the composite generates a harmful resonance that can be directed into a target&rsquo;s body, rupturing cell walls and causing organ stress. The wearer can increase the effect by flexing the limb and digits under the gauntlet, causing the crystal to record the subtle sounds of the body and its component matter to build stronger resonance. The cellular resonance gauntlet is the basic model. Focused frequencies of the molecular, atomic, and quantum models stimulate respectively smaller components of matter to deal correspondingly large amounts of damage.</p>"

As a reaction when someone within 60 feet of you casts a spell, you can violently thrash these limbs to send out disruptive vibrations. The spellcaster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the triggering spell, or the spell fails. Add 5 to this DC if you are augmented with a mk 2 scuttle engine. Once you have used your scuttle engine, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge it immediately.</p>"

In addition, when you fall from the saddle, it slows your fall, reducing the die size for falling damage by one (so 1d6 becomes 1d4).

You activate a sleeping sentry by leaning back into the exoskeletal harness, allowing it to gently lock you into a standing position while supporting your neck, spine, legs, and arms. The automated medical unit then injects you with a cocktail of barbiturates that puts you instantly to sleep for the next 8 hours (or until awoken by the sleeping sentry); an unwilling creature forced into the harness can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to remain conscious. Shortly thereafter, antigravitry circuitry within the disc activates, suspending the entire structure approximately 1 inch off the ground and moving along a preprogrammed patrol route at a speed of 20 feet. The disc can move over land and over water, but not underwater.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creatures who come within 30 feet of an activated sleeping sentry must succeed at a DC 25 Stealth check to fool the sleeping sentry&rsquo;s motion detectors, or else an integrated high-frequency proximity alarm sounds, waking you and releasing you from the harness to confront the threat.

The subject must attempt this saving throw no matter where it is in relation to the camera, so long as it&rsquo;s on the same plane.

If the helm is removed at any time during this period and then placed back onto the same subject, the 24 hours begin anew. Once this process is complete, the sovereign helm grants the wearer some control over constructs with the technological subtype.<br />While a sovereign helm has a different method of installation than most augmentations, it acts as a brain system augmentation in all other ways. You can&rsquo;t wear and make use of a sovereign helm if you have preexisting brain system implantation, nor can you install a brain system implantation while a sovereign helm&rsquo;s apparatuses are burrowed into your cranium.<br />Once the sovereign helm has fully rewritten your neural pathways, it allows you to spend a standard action in an attempt to assert some amount of control over a single construct with the technological subtype that you can see within 60 feet of you. A targeted construct must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier); on a failure, it must stop what is doing and can do only what you command (using only the following commands) until the end of your next turn.

The linked starship is returned to full Hull Points, while the various dents, scratches, and even holes in the linked starship&rsquo;s hull visibly transfer to the replica.

			"description": "<p>This vicious-looking clawed wand is used to detect and quickly remove foreign objects from under the skin. You can use the subdermal extractor only on an unconscious or willing target. The clawed end of the subdermal extractor contains a delicate sensor that evaluates the target&rsquo;s genetic material and scans for foreign objects (including alien eggs, biotech and cybernetic augmentations, tracking chips, etc.). To detect an anomalous object, you take a move action and must succeed at a Computers or Medicine check with a DC equal to 15 or 10 + the level of the implanted item, whichever is higher. If the implanted material was injected as part of a creature&rsquo;s attack, the DC is instead 15 + the CR of the attacking creature. As a standard action, you can deploy the subdermal extractor to remove anomalous material you have detected. This typically requires a successful DC 25 Medicine check, but this DC might be lower or higher at the GM&rsquo;s discretion (such as if the item is particularly small or if it has woven itself into the target&rsquo;s interior physiology). Whether or not you succeed or fail at the check, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage from the attempt. Each detection attempt uses a charge from the subdermal extractor, as does each removal attempt. You can use a subdermal extractor on yourself, but the DCs of skill checks to use it are increased by 2.<br /><br />Although a subdermal extractor can be used to quickly remove cybernetics or other augmentations, only the most disreputable back-alley shops use subdermal extractors for this purpose, and such augmentations still can&rsquo;t be resold.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/use</p>"

A creature affected by a synesthetic weapon is immune to this effect from the same weapon for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.

It soon found applications for thieves and explorers alike. Using the gloves, you can perceive and manipulate objects close at hand without actually touching them, and you can even sense details hidden just below the surface.<br /><br />While wearing a pair of&nbsp;tactokinesis gloves, you can use the Perception and Physical Science skills to examine a metal or technological construct or object within your reach, whether or not you can perceive the object with other senses. In addition, the gloves provide a +2 circumstance bonus to Engineering checks to assess stability or disable a device, and they count as necessary tools for such purposes. You can attempt such checks without directly touching the target, as well as use similar abilities that manipulate technology by touch, such as the overload mechanic class feature. In a zero-gravity environment, you can use the limited telekinesis provided by the gloves to pick up and move objects of up to 1 bulk without actually touching them. As a standard action, you can use the gloves to deliver a disruptive pulse to an @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype.

Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this ability (regardless of the result), it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.<br /><br />The range of this telekinesis is limited to your reach, as you must be almost touching the target to manipulate it.&nbsp;Tactokinesis gloves&nbsp;do not function through a force field.</p>"

		"Trafodi Paradox": {
			"name": "Trafodi Paradox",
			"description": "<p>The Trafodi Paradox is an intricately carved orb of red stone or coral, a foot in diameter. The carving forms a multilayered lattice within the sphere. Despite its substance and size, the Trafodi Paradox is very light.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the conquest of Vesk-2, the vesk invaders ignored the pleas of the planet&rsquo;s natives and ransacked the ancient vault containing the Trafodi Paradox. The inhabitants of Vesk- 2 had no written records of the sphere&mdash;only an oral legend that it was brought from the sky and sealed away during the Gap. A vesk warlord kept the artifact on Vesk-2, where it stayed for several generations before it came to the attention of high-ranking members of the Veskarium. The artifact was loaded onto a Veskarian military transport to be taken to Vesk Prime for further study. Distress signals recorded shortly thereafter indicate that vessel ran afoul of the Swarm, and no one has seen that starship or the Trafodi Paradox since. Those who have studied the accounts of Veskarian mystics who examined the artifact speculate that it is a transportation device but that it is either malfunctioning or designed for a truly alien and magically gifted species.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can activate the Trafodi Paradox. The artifact darkens and shrinks as its internal lattice realigns. It activates just before the start of your next turn, provided you&rsquo;re still conscious and holding the sphere. When you activate the Trafodi Paradox, it becomes a singularity in a square of your choice in your space or in a space adjacent to you. The singularity&rsquo;s physical manifestation is tiny, but it is considered to occupy a 5-foot cube.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the singularity appears, creatures within 1 mile of the singularity feel drawn to it. A creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or use all its actions to move as quickly as possible toward the singularity. Although this is a mindaffecting effect, creatures immune to such effects still feel the pull and might seek the source of this attraction despite no compulsion to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creatures within 120 feet of the singularity must succeed at a DC 25 Athletics check or a DC 20 Strength check to move farther from it, and even then does so at one-quarter its speed. Each round, at the start of your turn, the singularity performs a special combat maneuver with a +30 bonus to the attack roll. If a creature is within 120 feet of the singularity, compare the result of this attack roll to the creature&rsquo;s KAC + 8. If the maneuver is successful, that creature moves 5 feet toward the singularity, plus 1 foot per point the singularity&rsquo;s result exceeded the creature&rsquo;s KAC + 8; round the distance up to the nearest 5 feet. Huge or smaller unattended objects move 30 feet toward the singularity at the start of each of your turns, moving an additional 10 feet per size category below Medium or 10 fewer feet per size category above Medium.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature or object that enters the singularity&rsquo;s space is sucked into the void. While inside, a creature can take no actions other than a full action to escape, which requires a successful DC 30 Athletics check or DC 25 Strength check. A creature that ends its turn inside the singularity takes 5d10 force damage unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Will save to take half damage; if it succeeds by 5 or more, the creature negates the damage entirely. The creature that activated the artifact gains a +5 circumstance bonus to this saving throw. The amount of damage dealt by the void increases by 5d10 each round. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points, the creature&rsquo;s body is utterly destroyed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature that succeeds at a Will save within the singularity senses a presence in the void. In myriad voices, one of which the listener can understand, the presence offers salvation from the crushing gravity. A creature that accepts this salvation leaves the void, transported to another location in the galaxy or among the planes. Upon escaping in this way, a creature regains half of the Hit Points it lost to the singularity. Escapees with strong emotional attachments to one another often arrive in the same location, while enemies rarely land in the same place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The singularity created by the Trafodi Paradox lasts 13 minutes. When the singularity ends, the artifact disappears. Roll 1d20 as the control and 1d20 as the determiner. If the determiner is higher than the control, the Trafodi Paradox reappears in the possession of the creature that last activated it. Otherwise, the artifact could reappear anywhere in the galaxy. The creature that last activated the artifact can sense in which direction the artifact lies, provided the object isn&rsquo;t sealed in an area lined with starmetal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Trafodi Paradox can be destroyed only if it consumes the last member of the species that created it.</p>"

			"name": "Tytarian’s Anvil",
			"description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Ancient tales tell of a mammoth forge created in the depths of Hyrrfellhame by Zursvaater, father of fire giants, and granted to the fire giant warlord Tytarian on Golarion to craft arms and armor that would unify the fire giants to conquer new lands. The giants&rsquo; gambit ultimately failed, and the forge fell into disuse, in no small part because it was remote, impractical to move, and relied on a nearby volcano&rsquo;s heat to function properly. Sometime during the Gap, the forge relocated from Golarion to Crucible on the Near Space world Pholskar; however, while the new location included the forge&rsquo;s bellows, hand tools, and impossibly hot hearth, the centerpiece anvil had gone missing. The furious fire giant and slag giant smiths have created countless heat-resistant weapons with the remaining tools and modern technologies, arming hunters who search for the presumably stolen anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Tytarian&rsquo;s Anvil </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">is a massive blacksmithing anvil etched with runes that glow hungrily when near heated metal. While using the anvil, you treat your ranks in Engineering and Mysticism as though they were 5 higher for the purpose of crafting items, and you can treat such items as one size category smaller (minimum Medium) for the purpose of calculating how long it takes you to craft them. When crafting any weapon with an item level of 8 or higher, you can create and attach a </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">flaming </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">weapon fusion to that weapon without increasing the cost or creation time. Any equipment created with the anvil is immune to fire damage, but cold damage dealt to the equipment ignores half its hardness.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a move action, a creature can tap a weapon or worn piece of armor against </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Tytarian&rsquo;s Anvil</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">. A tapped weapon gains the burn 6d6 critical hit effect for 1 hour, and any fire damage dealt by the weapon ignores 5 points of the target&rsquo;s fire resistance. A tapped piece of armor grants its wearer protection against heat, providing the wearer fire resistance 50 against damage dealt by environmental hazards, plus fire resistance 10 against all other sources for 4 hours. This fire resistance can stack with one other source of fire resistance the wearer has. The anvil can augment up to 20 items in this way per day, after which any other users must spend 1 Resolve Point to activate this power.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Finally, the anvil can be installed in a starship as a special expansion bay that also functions as a tech bay. Once per round when a magic officer successfully performs the eldritch shot crew action or an engineer successfully uses the divert crew action to augment the starship&rsquo;s weapons, they draw upon the installed anvil&rsquo;s magic to also either replace one piece of ammunition for a starship weapon with the limited fire property (maximum 3 per encounter) or grant one of the starship&rsquo;s weapons one of the following weapon special properties until the beginning of the next helm phase: mystical</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 5pt;\">SOM</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, point (+10), or smoldering. On the next round after being hit by a smoldering weapon, the target starship&rsquo;s arc takes 2d6 additional damage (the damage is instead 4d6 for a heavy weapon or 6d6 for a capital weapon). For the eldritch shot action, this additional ammunition or special property must be granted to the weapon affected by eldritch shot.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The location of </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Tytarian&rsquo;s Anvil </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">remains a mystery, though some leads do exist. Rumors have associated the Hellknight Order of the Pyre with some powerful tool that grants their armaments especially deadly flames and has equipped elite Hellknights with fearsome new armor. It&rsquo;s also possible that Pholskar&rsquo;s giants still have the anvil, having relocated it to produce secret armaments while using its supposed theft as justification to invade nearby systems. What&rsquo;s certain, though, is anyone who does recover the anvil is sure to be hounded by giant bounty hunters</span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">.</span></p>"

		"Ungarato": {
			"name": "Ungarato",
			"description": "<p>Ungarato is one of the most powerful known relics of lost Golarion, though even greater artifacts have occasionally appeared throughout Absalom Station&rsquo;s history. Ungarato, also called the All-Consuming Killer or the Gun of Gluttony, is known to be one of the Alara&rsquo;hai, seven weapons of nearly divine magical power that were also referred to as the Seven Blades of Conviction or the Seven Swords of Sin. Although the fates of the other six Alara&rsquo;hai remain unknown, these epithets imply that Ungarato was once a sword of some kind, though when, how, and why this blade was reforged into a powerful machine gun with a bayonet is one of the relic&rsquo;s greatest mysteries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Much of Ungarato&rsquo;s history is lost, though scholars have shown that the weapon was created in its original form thousands of years before the Gap. The Arcanamirium&rsquo;s most learned esotericists agree that Ungarato&rsquo;s origin lies in ancient Thassilon, an empire ruled by spellcasting tyrants called runelords, which collapsed at the beginning of the period of Golarion&rsquo;s history known as the Age of Darkness. It is also generally agreed that the weapon&rsquo;s intended wielder was the Runelord of Gluttony, but a ferocious warrior stole the blade before it ever reached the runelord&rsquo;s hands. This barbarian warlord later became the champion of the runelord&rsquo;s successor, and it is believed that Ungarato took its name from this champion. Nothing definitive is known of Ungarato&rsquo;s fate after the fall of Thassilon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ungarato has a distinct appearance that is unlike any other specific model of longarm. It has a misty, spectral quality, but the weapon is as solid as any other. Ungarato functions as a paragon X-gen gun, and its bayonet is a molecular rift dueling sword, both of which have the ghost killer fusion. Two hands are required to wield Ungarato, and proficiency with basic melee weapons and heavy weapons is necessary to use the weapon without penalty for melee and ranged attacks, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ungarato glows with a bright, sickly green color whenever there is a creature of the undead type within 50 feet of its wielder, though the weapon gives no indication of the direction or number of undead within that range. Each time its wielder suffers the full effects of a critical hit (when damage reduction, energy resistance, or some other effect does not reduce the damage dealt or prevent any critical hit effect), Ungarato gains 1 point of viciousness. Whenever Ungarato scores a critical hit, it automatically spends 1 point of viciousness (if it has any) and adds the severe wound critical hit effect to the critical damage dealt. Any unused points of viciousness fade at the rate of 1 per hour. Ungarato also restores 10 Hit Points to its wielder (functioning as per mystic cure) each time it scores a critical hit (whether or not it has any points of viciousness).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ungarato is a unique artifact of extreme power and legendary reputation; as such, the weapon is effectively priceless and cannot simply be purchased. Indeed, its current owner and whereabouts are unknown, though Ungarato is widely believed to have resurfaced recently somewhere on Absalom Station. Legend claims that Ungarato was once sentient and held great powers that only functioned in the hands of a Thassilonian runelord, but there&rsquo;s no modern evidence to support either claim. Similarly, it is believed that only the rightful Runelord of Gluttony can break the weapon; Ungarato is otherwise impervious to damage or destruction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>X-gen guns are named for their external generator&mdash;a power pack that drives the automatic feed of the weapon. They are common on fortified bases and in large armed encampments.</p>"

Each UPB is a tiny multifunction component, not much larger than a grain of rice, capable of being configured to act as a brace, capacitor, circuit, diode, fastener, insulator, lens, modulator, pipe, resistor, and dozens of other constituent parts. UPBs can even be spun out into fabric, broken down into component chemicals, reconstituted into new chemicals, or supplemented with base materials (such as dirt or sand) to form massive braces or walls. The right combination of hundreds or even thousands of UPBs can create everything from a comm unit to a laser weapon to powered armor. In their raw form, UPBs have a bulk of 1 per 1,000 UPBs, though when aligned and configured they can easily take up less bulk, and when configured for a specific purpose that calls for a minimum size and bracing (possibly combining them with inert materials), they can have a higher bulk.<br /><br />UPBs are so ubiquitous that they are usable as currency in many major settlements and trade hubs. While credsticks are a more convenient and secure way to carry value, UPBs have the advantage of direct utility and untraceability. They are a popular way to pay smugglers and criminals, but they are also useful for trade missions to systems with UPB technology that don&rsquo;t use credits as currency. The value of the Pact Worlds&rsquo; credit is based on the economic utility of a single UPB.</p>"

You can twist the cylinder in a preset pattern as a move action, deactivating the alarm and respooling the wire around the cylinder.</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-right: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-left: 0em; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.3em; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-caps: small-caps; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">Table 1-25: Warning Wire</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 551px; background-color: #292929; border-right: 1px solid white; border-left: 1px solid white; border-top-color: white; border-bottom-color: white; border-image: initial; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; height: 102px;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px; height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; text-align: center; width: 134px; height: 17px;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Model</strong></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 119px; height: 17px;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 265px; height: 17px;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">DC to Notice</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e; height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; text-align: center; width: 134px; height: 17px;\">Mk 1</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 119px; height: 17px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 265px; height: 17px;\">24</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; text-align: center; width: 134px; height: 17px;\">Mk 2</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 119px; height: 17px;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 265px; height: 17px;\">28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e; height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; text-align: center; width: 134px; height: 17px;\">Mk 3</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 119px; height: 17px;\">12</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 265px; height: 17px;\">32</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 34px;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; text-align: center; width: 134px; height: 34px;\">Mk 4</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 119px; height: 34px;\">16</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid white; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 265px; height: 34px;\">36<br /><br /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>40;&nbsp;<strong>Usage</strong> 1/hour</p>"

This newfound fashion of flickering flames was dubbed infernowear. It wasn&rsquo;t long before the same azers figured out how to make similar clothes interwoven with planar fabrics from each of the Elemental Planes, creating garments of shifting sands, roiling snowfalls, or writhing lightning (dubbed dustwear, blizzardwear, and boltwear, respectively). These crafting techniques were thought to be lost during the Gap until an environmental scientist and amateur tailor found examples of these garments at the Brass Bazaar in the Burning Archipelago. She was able to reproduce these garments and began selling them under the general name of weatherwear, though the items have an unfortunate side effect, as detailed below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each type of weatherwear can be integrated into any style of nonmagical clothing, granting the benefits of that clothing in addition to its own benefits, though weatherwear must be worn over armor and you can wear only one type of weatherwear at a time. While wearing a specific type of weatherwear, you gain resistance 5 to the energy damage type associated with the garment&rsquo;s elemental fabric (acid for dustwear, cold for blizzardwear, electricity for boltwear, and fire for infernowear). In addition, once per day, you can reroll a failed saving throw that would result in you taking energy damage of the corresponding type. However, if you roll a 1 on that second saving throw, you lose the provided energy resistance and instead gain vulnerability to that energy type for 1 minute.</p>"
